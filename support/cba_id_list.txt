4202:            <p> Example: Pilot A, a 757 Captain, holds an award to A300 CAP and is receiving passover pay to A300 CAP. He was part of the initial cadre of Check Airmen for the 757.

The Provo’s schedule shall be governed by the applicable provisions of Section 11 as if the Provo was bidding in pay only status.

An initial cadre Check Airman shall be considered to be in the pool of pilots in the crew position for which the pilot is receiving the pay rate (e.g., a MD-11 MEM Captain, selected as an initial cadre pilot candidate, holds an award on the initial System Bid for the 757 MEM Captain, and receives, through the operation of <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11O">Section 11.O.</a>, the pay rate for an MD-11 Captain; if a System Bid publishes a Current Staffing Level greater than Maximum Staffing Level, in the MD-11 MEM Captain crew position, the pilot will be considered as participating in that pool, and not as a 757 MEM Captain). If the pilot’s participation in that System Bid was in the crew position for which the pilot is performing duties as a Check Airman, the Company may continue to use the pilot as a Check Airman if the pilot is re-designated a Provo. In such case, the Company may continue to use the (newly designated) Provo until the expiration of 24 months following the introduction of the new aircraft into revenue service or 6 months after the close of that System Bid, whichever is later.</p>
