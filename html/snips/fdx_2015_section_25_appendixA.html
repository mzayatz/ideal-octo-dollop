    <p style="text-align: center">INITIAL SIG PARAMETERS AND STARTING VALUES</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">HARD PARAMETERS</p>
    <p>The Company must apply hard parameters in the bid pack construction process unless the Vice President, Flight Operations and the MEC Chairman agree otherwise in writing. Any such agreement may contain conditions and/or limitations, as mutually agreed between the V.P. and the MEC Chairman.</p>
    <p>Domestic</p>
    <p>1. A pilot shall not be scheduled as a required crew member in excess of 7:35 block hours in a single duty period.</p>
    <p>2. When an air deadhead follows flight deck duty in the same duty period, at least 1:30 shall be scheduled between block-in of the FedEx revenue flight and departure of the deadhead.</p>
    <p>3. When an air deadhead follows flight deck duty in the same duty period, no more than 4 hours shall be scheduled between block-in of the FedEx revenue flight and departure of the deadhead.</p>
    <p>4. Any duty period scheduled for a critical period departure(s) shall be limited to 3 departures in the critical period or afterward.</p>
    <p>5. Trips that depart domicile in the critical period and return to domicile in the same duty period (out and backs) shall be scheduled to block-in by 10:00 am LBT.</p>
    <p>6. The critical duty rig function shall be set at 1.0.</p>
    <p>International</p>
    <p>1. No trip shall contain more than two round trip ocean crossings. After completion of the first, the second must commence in the next duty period (i.e., the duty period immediately following the completion of the first round trip ocean crossing must contain an ocean crossing)</p>
    <p>2. No trip shall be scheduled to have more than 5 different continental arrivals (i.e., Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America). For purposes of this parameter a duty period that arrives on a different continent, but has a TZD of 3 or fewer shall not count as a separate continental arrival.</p>
    <p>3. Gateway City Parameter:</p>
    <p>a.   Following entry at any airport in the United States (Gateway City) from an international location, an International Pairing shall have no more than two domestic duty periods. The combined total number of operating legs in those two duty periods shall not exceed two. In addition, there shall be no deadhead legs scheduled in the same duty period as an operating leg, and the number of air deadhead legs shall be limited to two.</p>
    <p>b.   For pairings to which International SIG parameter number 1 (maximum ocean crossings) applies, the gateway city limitation applies to the last arrival at a gateway city from an ocean crossing.</p>
    <p>c.   Prior to leaving a U.S. Gateway City to an international location, an international pairing shall have no more than two domestic duty periods containing no more than four operating legs total.</p>
    <p>4. An international duty period shall not be constructed in excess of 7+35 block hours without at least three airmen on board (e.g., MD-11 with RFO).</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">SOFT PARAMETERS</p>
    <p>The Company may override a soft parameter(s), provided it gives at least 45 days written notice, prior to the delivery of the preliminary pairings, of its intent to do so and the reasons therefore. Other soft parameters may be added by agreement of the Association and the Company.</p>
    <p>Domestic</p>
    <p>1. The maximum length of carryover trips for each bid period shall be 7 days in the subsequent bid period.</p>
    <p>2. If a duty period starts in the critical period, and has three landings, such duty period shall be scheduled to block in by 1000 LBT.</p>
    <p>3. A standby period shall not be scheduled in the same duty period as a deadhead return to base.</p>
    <p>4. A domestic multiple day trip shall not be scheduled for a cumulative total of more than 13 landings in the duty periods that operate in the critical period, unless approved by the SIG.</p>
    <p>International</p>
    <p>1. If a trip operates in the Asian theatre and transit 5 TZDs or more, the final landing in any 3-leg duty period must occur between 0900 and 2000 LT for the MD11 and between 1200 and 2000 LT for the B777.</p>
    <p>2. If a trip transits 5 TZDs or more and contains a 3 leg duty period with the last landing in mainland China (e.g., not TPE, HKG), that trip will contain at least a 32 hour layover preceding such duty.</p>
    <p>3. [Reserved]</p>
    <p>4. A duty that begins between the hours 0100-0459 (Local time) shall not contain the following flight sequence (IND-ORD-ANC).</p>
    <p>5. If a trip, with an RFO, begins in ANC with a duty starting between 1500-2300, such duty shall be scheduled for 1 landing.</p>
    <p>6. If a pairing is scheduled with a CDG-CAN leg immediately followed by a westbound duty period of 5 TZDs or greater, then a layover of at least 36 hours will precede such westbound duty period.</p>
    <p>7. A duty period containing an intermediate stop at CAN shall be scheduled with a maximum of 3 landings.</p>
