<p>BB.  Scheduling Improvement Group (SIG)</p>
<p>A. Statement of Intent</p>
<p>The parties agree that the construction of the pairings and lines each month can immensely affect both the Company and the pilots. The purpose of the SIG is to provide, through joint participation and cooperation, a process that promotes, to the greatest extent possible, a reasonable balance between the following competing interests of both parties.</p>
<p>1.   For the Company, the efficiency and productivity of the pairings impact operational safety, reliability, cost, and business competitiveness that are critical for proper system and operational coordination. The flight pairing and line construction must be managed and maintained within acceptable financial and operational limits.</p>
<p>2.   For the pilots, flight pairings and lines represent an important factor in their work environment, including the promotion of a safe and effective flight operation. Pairings and lines also contribute, along with seat position, seniority, and work effort to a pilot’s income opportunities. A pilot’s work schedule and the coordination of that work schedule with other flight, travel, and operational responsibilities can impact a pilot’s ability to operate an aircraft safely.</p>
<p>B. Composition of SIG</p>
<p>The SIG shall consist of 4 members. The Company shall select two representatives, one of whom shall be a seniority holding member of Flight Management, and shall designate a SIG Chairman from the two representatives. The Association’s two SIG members shall be the MEC Scheduling Committee Chairman and Vice-Chairman or other line pilots designated by the Association.</p>
<p>C. Responsibilities of the SIG</p>
<p>1.   Oversee Monthly Pairing and Line Construction Process</p>
<p>a. Pairing Construction</p>
<p>The SIG shall ensure that the pairings and lines are constructed, through coordination of the PSIT with CRP specialists. The Crew Planning Department shall build the pairings. The SIG shall have oversight to ensure there is a mutually effective avenue for input into the pairing construction process between the PSIT and CRP Specialists.</p>
<p>i.   Manage Pairing Generation</p>
<p>(a)    The SIG shall work with the Company to produce and develop the parameters that are input into the pairing generator. The Company and the SIG shall work jointly to utilize and manage pairing generation to produce safe, legal and reliable trips that are both flyable in terms of quality of life and cost effective. The Association SIG shall be provided with access to the Company fatigue modeling software for the purposes of evaluating domestic pairings.</p>
<p>(b)    If the Company develops or purchases software including new or different functions for use in pairing generation, the Company shall notify the Association SIG members in writing, at least 45 days prior to using such software in the pairing generation process. The Company shall take input from the Association SIG members regarding the application of such software. The Association SIG members may dispute new functions.</p>
<p>(c)    Upon request by the MEC Scheduling Chairman, the Company shall advise the Association SIG members of significant changes in the settings of existing functions that led to a particular solution.</p>
<p>(d)    Within 30 days of the effective date of the Agreement, the Company shall provide the Association SIG members with a list of each function used in pairing generation and a description of its purpose. Subsequently, this list shall be provided upon request of the MEC Scheduling Chairman.</p>
<p>ii.  Pairings Conference Call</p>
<p> The pairings conference call shall provide the opportunity for PSIT and the Association SIG members’ input of needed repair and design changes. The MEC Scheduling Chairman will designate a lead PSIT member for each base (or at the election of the MEC Scheduling Chairman, each equipment type), who shall be the primary spokesperson for his subgroup on the conference call. The pairings conference call shall include:</p>
<p>(a)    the SIG members, or their designees;</p>
<p>(b)    the participating members of the PSIT and Reviewers, as designated by the MEC Scheduling Committee Chairman; and</p>
<p>(c)    appropriate Company employee(s) involved in pairing and line construction.</p>
<p>iii. Pairing Variety</p>
<p>The Company recognizes that having an assortment of pairing lengths (e.g., 1 day, 2 day, 3 day, 4 day, and longer pairings) facilitates trip trading and provides a variety of choice in regular lines. While pairing solutions inevitably change along with the business, the Company will ensure that, from the perspective of the overall FedEx Flight Operation, there is a selection of trip lengths available for pilots to bid and fly (e.g., some trip lengths may only be available in certain fleets and bases and not others, etc.).</p>
<p>b. Line Construction</p>
<p>The SIG shall manage the PSIT participation in the line construction and dispute process.</p>
<p>c. Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>The SIG shall evaluate both pairings and lines with regard to their impact on safety (e.g., consideration of circadian rhythm disruptions, compounding effects of fatigue, etc.), reliability, reasonable crew desires, and cost effectiveness.</p>
<p>d. Bid Pack Production Timeline</p>
<p>Unless otherwise agreed by the MEC Scheduling Chairman and the SIG Chairman, or unless prevented by circumstances beyond the control of either party, the following timeline shall be observed for the construction of the bid period package. Target dates and “Not Later Than” (NLT) dates are measured from the target date for publication of the bid period package:</p>
<p>i.   The timeline for delivery of the preliminary pairings to the PSIT and reviewers shall be:</p>
<p>(a)    Target: 13 days</p>
<p>(b)    NLT:    11 days</p>
<p>ii.  The timeline for the pairings conference call shall be:</p>
<p>(a)    Target: 8 days</p>
<p>(b)    NLT:    7 days</p>
<p>iii. The timeline for the delivery of the final pairings to the PSIT and reviewers</p>
<p>(a)    Target: 6 days</p>
<p>(b)    NLT:    4 days</p>
<p>iv.   The timeline for the publication of the bid period package shall be:</p>
<p>(a)    Target  Day 0</p>
<p>(b)    NLT Day +1</p>
<p>e. Management of SIG Parameters</p>
<p> The SIG shall work to ensure that the collection of SIG parameters are effective in guiding pairing generation so that the automated solutions further the goals for the SIG process as outlined in Section 25.BB.A. To facilitate this process, there shall be two types of SIG parameters—hard parameters and soft parameters, both of which are applicable in the bid period package construction process.</p>
<p>i.   The Company must apply hard parameters in the bid pack construction process unless the Vice President, Flight Operations and the MEC Chairman agree otherwise in writing. Any such agreement may contain conditions and/or limitations, as mutually agreed between the V.P. and the MEC Chairman.</p>
<p>ii.  The Company may override a soft parameter(s), provided it gives at least 45 days written notice, prior to the delivery of the preliminary pairings, of its intent to do so and the reasons therefore. This notice shall be sent to the MEC Scheduling Chairman. The Association may dispute the Company’s decision via the VP/MEC Chairman track for resolution of disputes as described in Section 25.BB.G. Other soft parameters may be added by agreement of the Association and the Company.</p>
<p>2.   Manage the Pilot Scheduling Improvement Team (PSIT)</p>
<p>a. Composition of PSIT</p>
<p>A primary PSIT member participates directly in the bid period build process and is compensated as such in any given bid period. A back-up PSIT member is a fully trained member assisting the primary(s) in a given bid period through trip review and conference call participation. The roles are rotational and are scheduled by the MEC Scheduling Committee chairman. PSIT members shall be line pilots selected by the Association with the consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.</p>
<p>b. Number of PSIT members</p>
<p>The number of primary PSIT members per base shall be predicated on the crew position with the most lines and on the line count for three consecutive bid periods. There shall be:</p>
<p>i.   1 primary PSIT member if the number of lines is 100 or less;</p>
<p>ii.  2 primary PSIT members if the number of lines is between 101 and 350;</p>
<p>iii. An additional primary PSIT member for each increment of 250 lines (e.g., the third PSIT member is added at 351 lines, the fourth is added at 600 lines, etc.); and</p>
<p>iv.  There shall be one back-up PSIT member for each base, which shall be increased by one for each 300 lines, measured in the same manner as for primary PSIT members.</p>
<p>Example: Suppose there are 280 Captain lines in the Memphis MD-11 base and 320 First Officer lines in that base. The number of back-up PSIT members is 2, since the number of lines is more than 300. When the number of MEM 11 F/O lines reaches 351 for three consecutive bid periods, the number of primary PSIT members assigned to the MEM 11 base shall increase to 3.</p>
<p>c. Duties of PSIT</p>
<p>i.   The PSIT shall report to the SIG and shall perform its duties consistent with the goals outlined for the SIG/PSIT process, as set forth in Section 25.BB.A.</p>
<p>ii.  The PSIT shall participate each bid period in the conference call and other joint meetings called to provide constructive input into trip and line construction. Such input shall include, but not be limited to, pilot fatigue issues, weather anomalies, factors which cause variations in actual versus scheduled duty times, air traffic control delays, and other operational considerations related to the flight schedule.</p>
<p>iii. The PSIT shall provide the SIG and flight management with constructive feedback received from line pilots with regard to trips and lines for the purpose of performing the functions within the purview of the SIG/PSIT.</p>
<p>3.   Coordinate Cross Divisional Cooperation in Schedule Construction</p>
<p>a. Scope of Required Coordination</p>
<p>The construction of the monthly flight schedule is influenced by numerous groups within the Company. Promoting the closest practical coordination between the core groups responsible for the final airline schedule is essential to accomplishing the goals stated in Section 25.BB.A. The groups most directly involved in affecting the published flight schedule are: Global Network Planning, Crew Resource Planning, Flight Management, GOC, CRS, Aircraft Acquisitions, Charter Operations, and Flight Safety.</p>
<p>b. Quarterly Cross-Sectional Meeting</p>
<p>i.   To facilitate cooperation between these different areas of the Company which impact pilot schedule construction, and to promote a greater level of mutual understanding, unless otherwise agreed by the MEC Scheduling Chairman and the SIG Chairman, the parties shall meet each calendar quarter with designated representatives from each of the above areas to review, discuss, and share information in an attempt to foster a better understanding of the problems faced by both the Company and the pilots. The SIG Chairman will conduct the meeting. To the greatest extent possible, this group will mutually resolve concerns about flight schedules. At this quarterly meeting, the parties shall also discuss any upcoming changes that are likely to impact the future quarter’s flight schedules, so that problems and disruptions accompanying the changes in constructing future flight schedules can be anticipated and minimized.</p>
<p>ii.  Unless otherwise agreed by the MEC Scheduling Chairman and the SIG Chairman all SIG members shall attend and participate in the quarterly cross sectional meetings and shall work together to recommend jointly to flight management ways in which future schedules can be improved or adjusted. Recommendations to Flight Management shall be in writing and approved by all members of the SIG.</p>
<p>4.   Participate in Development of New Software/Hardware</p>
<p>The SIG shall have regular input into the process of purchasing or developing any new software or hardware that will be used to construct pairings and/or lines. Additionally, if the Company modifies computer systems that pilots use to interface with CRS or CRP (e.g., display of reserve leveling lists, display of open time, input screens, etc.), the SIG shall have input into such modifications.</p>
<p>5.   Communications</p>
<p>General communications to the crew force about the SIG activities and its accomplishments shall be mutually agreed to and jointly reviewed by the Company and the Association before publication, with appropriate consideration for confidentiality.</p>
<p>6.   Provide SIG Input and Feedback on Ancillary Issues</p>
<p>The MEC Scheduling Chairman shall have the ability to provide input into the percentage of credit hours left in open time to facilitate trip trading, and into the process for constructing reserve and secondary lines. The MEC Scheduling Chairman shall also have the ability to provide feedback regarding any revisions or the creation of flying outside the bid period package process.</p>
<p>7.   Staffing Consultation</p>
<p>The Association SIG shall be consulted regarding the staffing for each crew position, for the purposes of Section 25.E.5., and shall be provided that determination monthly with the distribution of the monthly Final Pairings.</p>
<p>8.   Known Reserve Days (Section 25.A.4.)</p>
<p>a. Prior to the release of each bid period package, CRP shall provide the Association SIG the following for each crew position:</p>
<p>i.   The planned number of reserve days; and</p>
<p>ii.  RP and block size distributions of those reserve days not built into published reserve lines, which shall be representative of the RP distribution of the published reserve lines.</p>
<p>b. At the beginning of the Build Week (SIG In-Brief), for each crew position, the SIG shall be provided the previous bid period’s actual total reserve coverage (i.e., total reserve coverage after secondary line construction). If the actual total reserve coverage for a crew position exceeds the planned coverage for two consecutive bid periods, the SIG shall adjust the planned number of reserve days accordingly for the following bid period.</p>
<p>D. Access to Information and Confidentiality</p>
<p>1.   Flight Operations Plans and Analysis shall provide all members of the SIG such information in the Company’s possession, as mutually agreed between the Company and the SIG, which is necessary to perform the SIG’s tasks. At a minimum, this information will include the following data in a mutually agreed upon format:</p>
<p>a. A daily report of all trips that exceeded the operational on-duty or block limits, including trip number(s) and the reasons for the extension(s).</p>
<p>b. A bid period report of all trips that exceeded the scheduled on-duty or block limitations, including at a minimum, the trip numbers.</p>
<p>c. A bid period report that identifies trips flown by number, frequency of occurrence, CH value and assignment code. This information shall be available only on Company property unless otherwise agreed by the Vice President, Flight Operations or his designee.</p>
<p>d. Sick leave utilization by crew position, for each bid period.</p>
<p>e. Reserve utilization by reserve period type, by crew position, for each bid period.</p>
<p>f. Volunteer and Draft incidence by crew position, for each bid period.</p>
<p>g. Actual block hours by crew position, for each bid period.</p>
<p>h. Actual credit hours by crew position, for each bid period.</p>
<p>i. Block hour distribution by crew position, for each bid period.</p>
<p>j.    All revisions of specific trips, made viewable by Association SIG members.</p>
<p>k.  A report, by occurrence, detailing the reason for and the frequency of business necessity deadheads on a Company aircraft, chartered jet carrier, Company corporate business jet aircraft or on a scheduled U.S. certificated air carrier operating under FAR Part 135. All members of the SIG shall be notified of the reasons for any action by the end of the next business day.</p>
<p>2.   The SIG, PSIT, and reviewers recognize that they may be entrusted with information not generally made available to line pilots, or to the public, that constitutes confidential information, in which the Company has a significant and valuable proprietary interest. This information shall be kept confidential and shall not be published nor shall it be distributed outside the Company to any third party for any purpose, without the express written permission of the V.P. of Flight, nor shall it be used for any purpose other than to meet SIG responsibilities outlined in this Section.</p>
<p>E. Initial Resolution of Scheduling Disputes – System Chief Pilot and Fatigue Risk Management Group (FRMG) Tracks</p>
<p>The SIG may formally dispute particular pairings in accordance with the following processes that are inconsistent with the goals and purposes established elsewhere in this Agreement, the Company’s Fatigue Risk Management Plan (FRMP), and/or the Fatigue Risk Management System (FRMS) (as administered by the Company’s FRMG). In no case shall disputes made under the provisions of this Section cause a delay in the publication of the monthly bid package.</p>
<p>Intent: The language regarding not creating a delay in bid pack publication is not meant to allow a “fix it next month” mentality. The process is intended to be as expedited as possible, but it will not be permitted to jeopardize the timely publication of bid packs.</p>
<p>1.   The SIG may use the pairing dispute procedures described in this paragraph only to dispute new pairings. A “new” pairing is one which is materially different from the way the pairing was constructed in the three previous bid periods. A pairing is not new if it has been built and flown materially the same way without challenge for three consecutive bid periods after 5/31/1999. A change in a deadhead carrier or service provider (e.g., change from Delta to United or from Super Shuttle to Argenbright) shall not, by itself, constitute a material change unless such deadhead change eliminates a layover or occurs mid-pairing.</p>
<p>2.   The SIG shall provide a written list of all disputed pairings prior to the monthly conference call/meeting and shall identify each disputed pairing and the reasons why it is unacceptable during that conference call. The Company may agree to rebuild the pairing to alleviate the concerns expressed by the SIG. The SIG may withdraw a dispute after discussion during the conference call/meeting. If, between the pairings conference call and the issuance of the final pairings, a new pairing design is built for inclusion in the bid period package, the SIG shall have the ability to dispute such new design as if it had been part of the preliminary pairing solution.</p>
<p> Intent: Disputed pairings shall be corrected in the current month to the maximum extent possible without delaying the process.</p>
<p>3.   If there are pairings that remain disputed after the conference call/meeting, the SIG shall meet and attempt to resolve the pairings still in dispute. If all such disputes are not resolved by the SIG, the SIG shall select the appropriate dispute resolution track (i.e., System Chief Pilot track or FRMG track) based on the underlying rationale of the dispute.</p>
<p>4.   System Chief Pilot Track</p>
<p>a. The SIG shall present the System Chief Pilot (SCP), or his designee, with the written rationale explaining why each pairing should be changed.</p>
<p>b. The SCP or his designee shall review each disputed pairing and may direct that the pairing be rebuilt to the SIG’s satisfaction. The SIG may withdraw the dispute after the meeting with the SCP or his designee.</p>
<p>c. If there are pairings that remain disputed after meeting with the SCP, or his designee, the following process shall apply to each bid period package which contains disputed pairings for the immediately upcoming bid period only:</p>
<p>i.   If the number of remaining disputed pairings in a particular bid period package does not exceed 5% of the total number of pairings in that bid period package, the disputed pairings shall not be included on bid lines without SIG approval. Such pairings shall appear in open time and shall be available for ordinary open time assignment, or for placement on a secondary or custom line if specifically requested by a pilot holding such line.</p>
<p>ii.  If the number of remaining disputed pairings in a particular bid period package exceeds 5% of the total number of pairings in that bid period package, the SIG shall choose the pairings which shall be placed in open time as described in Section 25.BB.E.4.c.i. (i.e., up to 5% of the total number of pairings in the bid period package). The remaining disputed pairings may be built into bid lines.</p>
<p>iii. When calculating the 5% referenced in Sections 25.BB.E.4.c.i. and ii., a bid period package with pairings that are not identical in all seat positions shall be treated as separate bid period packages for each seat position. If a particular flight sequence which is the cause of a dispute appears in several pairings, those pairings shall count as one pairing for purposes of the 5%.</p>
<p>5.   FRMG Track (Fatigue-Related Disputes Only)</p>
<p>a. If the only underlying rationale for the dispute is based on a fatigue-related concern, the dispute must follow the FRMG track.</p>
<p>b. The SIG shall transmit to the FERC the written rationale explaining why each pairing should be changed.</p>
<p>c. The FERC shall analyze the pairing for its impact on pilot alertness. At a minimum this will include the fatigue model output of the Company and Association’s fatigue modeling software.</p>
<p>i.   The FERC shall attempt to reach consensus on a recommendation to:</p>
<p>(a)    Have the pairing rebuilt; or</p>
<p>(b)    Perform data collection on the pairing.</p>
<p>ii.  In the absence of consensus the pairing will immediately be referred to the DCSC for evaluation. The DCSC shall make a recommendation to:</p>
<p>(a)    Have the pairing rebuilt; or</p>
<p>(b)    Perform data collection on the pairing.</p>
<p>iii. In the absence of DCSC consensus, the pairing shall be referred to the dispute track chosen by the Association MEC Scheduling Chairman.</p>
<p>d. Should the FERC’s/DCSC’s recommendation be to perform data collection, then:</p>
<p>i.   All fatigue report data gathered on the pairing shall be promptly reviewed and analyzed by the Fatigue Event Review Committee (FERC) and transmitted to the FRMG for review and consideration;</p>
<p>ii. The pairing shall be included in the Data Collection Steering Committee’s human performance/alertness data collection and analysis efforts;</p>
<p>iii. The parties may solicit feedback from pilots operating the pairing only by operation of the Collection of Human Performance/Alertness Data MOU, the Company’s FRMP, or Section 12.A.9.; and</p>
<p>iv.  The pairing shall be studied as a Category 3 pairing as defined in Section 12.A.10.</p>
<p>[Note: Both parties agree not to intentionally characterize such pairings in a way that compromises the scientific validity of data gathered on such pairings until the dispute is finally resolved.]</p>
<p>e. At its next regularly scheduled meeting, the FRMG shall review the pairing presented to it by the SIG (including the underlying rationale for the dispute), the data and analysis of the FERC (if any) on the pairing, and the human performance/alertness data collected from pilots operating the pairing since initiation of the FRMG track. To the extent that preliminary or final analyses of those human performance/alertness data are available, those analyses shall also be presented to the FRMG. The SIG may withdraw the dispute after presentation to the FRMG.</p>
<p>f. During the FRMG’s review of the pairing, the FRMG’s focus shall be on whether the pairing under review is consistent with the goals of the Company’s FRMP and/or FRMS and shall consider only whether the pairing under review is constructed with appropriate consideration of cumulative and transient fatigue. After completing its review, the FRMG may either:</p>
<p>i.   Approve the pairing as designed by the Company;</p>
<p>ii.  Direct that the pairing be rebuilt; or</p>
<p>iii. Conduct an enhanced review of the pairing.</p>
<p>g. If the FRMG decides to conduct an enhanced review of the pairing, the enhanced review period (ERP) shall be 3 bid periods in duration. The FRMG may consider revision of the pairing at any time during the ERP. At the end of the ERP, the FRMG may extend the ERP up to an additional 3 bid periods.</p>
<p>h. In addition to any human performance/alertness data and fatigue report data gathered from pilots operating the pairing during the FRMG’s review, the FRMG shall also consider the manner in which the pairing is assigned (e.g., BLA, reserve, standby, etc.), the relative seniority of pilots assigned to the pairing, the turnover of each pairing (e.g., dropped, sick, etc.), and the operational history of the pairing (e.g., operational revisions, extensions, etc.).</p>
<p>i. During the FRMG review process, the members of the FRMG shall attempt to reach consensus. If the members of the FRMG reach consensus, that decision shall be final. If the members of the FRMG are unable to reach consensus on an issue, the matter shall be jointly presented to the Vice President, Flight Operations within 5 business days of the FRMG meeting. The Vice President shall render a written decision within 5 business days of the presentation of the matter. The Vice President shall send copies of the decision to the members of the FRMG. If the Association disagrees with the decision, it may appeal the matter to the Senior Vice President of Flight Operations, whose decision shall be final.</p>
<p>6.   If a pairing routinely goes into operational limits that pairing shall be rebuilt.</p>
<p>7.   If the Association SIG members elect to pursue the dispute further they shall choose between the mutually exclusive processes described in Section 25.BB.F. and G. If the Association SIG members do not choose a dispute track after having disputed a pairing for four bid periods, the SIG Chairman may initiate the SIG Neutral track.</p>
<p>F. Final Resolution of Scheduling Disputes: SIG Neutral Track</p>
<p>If the Association SIG members elect to pursue the SIG neutral track, the following procedure shall apply.</p>
<p>1.   Upon written request by the chairman of the SIG, the SCP shall convene a Scheduling Dispute Board. The board shall be composed of the SCP, the MEC Chairman, one Company SIG representative and one Association SIG representative.</p>
<p>a. The board shall meet within 5 calendar days to review appropriate data, including the flying history of the disputed pairing(s), at issue and discuss reasonable options on how the disputed pairing can be reconfigured in light of the operational requirements. Both sides shall use their best efforts to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>b. If the disputed pairing can be reconstructed, rebuilt, or combined into another pairing so that the overall cost of the pairing is the same or essentially the same as prior to the reconstruction and the change does not compromise system form or reliability, then the pairing shall be changed accordingly.</p>
<p>c. Additionally, if on a recurring basis, a pairing, disputed or not, appears in open time and is routinely avoided by pilots trip trading or eligible for make-up, OTP, etc., and therefore must be assigned to a reserve pilot, the above procedure shall apply, unless the Association elects to pursue the VP/MEC Chairman track instead.</p>
<p>2.   If a schedule construction issue(s) or pairing dispute(s) is not solved in the SIG, the quarterly meeting, or at the Scheduling Dispute Board levels, the ALPA SIG may choose to submit the dispute to an independent neutral mutually selected by both parties. The neutral shall gather facts, report findings and within 14 calendar days offer a recommendation to the Senior V.P. of Flight Operations. The neutral may recommend the course of action that he finds which balances the competing needs and interests of both parties. The cost of the neutral shall be borne equally by both the Company and the Association.</p>
<p>3.   The Senior V.P. of Flight Operations shall review the findings of the neutral within 7 business days and issue a final decision concerning the matter. That decision shall be final and shall be sent to the neutral, the V.P. Flight Ops, and the members of the SIG.</p>
<p>G. Final Resolution of Scheduling Disputes: VP/MEC Chairman Track</p>
<p>The MEC Chairman may elect to notify the Vice President, Flight Operations that he is invoking the VP/MEC Chairman track regarding a particular SIG dispute. The notification shall be in writing and shall state the unresolved concerns/problems and the Association’s position. Upon receipt, the Vice President, Flight Operations shall promptly have the stated unresolved concerns/problems investigated, including a review of the process undertaken thus far regarding the dispute. After at least one bid period of flying data is gathered on the disputed pairing, the Vice President, Flight Operations shall meet with the MEC Chairman at a mutually acceptable date and time to review the results of the investigation and discuss options for dealing with the unresolved concerns/problems. Following the meeting, the Vice President, Flight Operations shall advise the MEC Chairman in writing of what actions, if any, the Company shall take to address the presented concerns.</p>
<p>H. Removal and Compensation of Association Members of SIG and PSIT</p>
<p>1.   Removal</p>
<p>a. The Association members of the SIG shall be removed from flying at the Association’s notification as provided in Section 18.A.2.a.</p>
<p>b. PSIT members shall be removed from flying as provided in Section 18.A.2.b., provided such members are not requesting removal of an activity over a designated corporate holiday. Requests for removal over a holiday shall be processed as provided in Section 18.A.3., unless the build week conflicts with a corporate holiday in which case the removals shall be processed as provided in Section 18.A.2.b.</p>
<p>2.   Compensation</p>
<p>a. SIG members</p>
<p>The Association SIG members shall receive compensation and benefits as provided in Section 18.</p>
<p>b. PSIT members</p>
<p>The primary members participating in a build month shall be compensated by the Company by being removed from scheduled activities with a standard value of 30 CH (12 CH for any FDA with fewer than 35 lines, 18 CH for any FDA with 35 to 55 lines, and 30 CH for any FDA with 55 or more lines) at the discretion of the SIG for each month that he is designated to complete the pairings/line construction cycle for his designated aircraft. Any additional credit hour value shall be reimbursed by the Association in accordance with Section 18, or the pilot shall be eligible to make up the difference. The Association shall notify the Company whether the excess credit hours are to be removed for Association business or dropped eligible for make-up. If a PSIT member is assigned to work additional days, he shall be removed from scheduled activities with a value of 6 CH for each additional work day (or portion thereof), and he shall be eligible to make up the difference between credit hours removed and credit hours earned for PSIT activities. PSIT members shall be entitled to OTP status for any make-up entitlement arising from this paragraph.</p>
<p>I. Resignation</p>
<p>A SIG or PSIT member may resign with notice of at least one full bid period.</p>
<p>J. General</p>
<p>1.   Office Space for PSIT Members</p>
<p>The Company shall provide a closed office space large enough to accommodate the entire PSIT at separate work stations with all supporting equipment that facilitates the line build process.</p>
<p>2.   SIG/PSIT Travel and Expenses</p>
<p>a. The MEC Scheduling Committee Chairman will provide the Company a list of the PSIT and Association SIG participants that will be building bid period packages for the following bid period. Except for PSIT members assigned to an FDA, the Company shall provide a commercial airline ticket to the SIG/PSIT members to or from Memphis for the build week and other mutually agreed SIG/PSIT work. The Association SIG/PSIT members shall have the ability to utilize their deviation banks and/or business jumpseats (or equivalent jumpseat status) to travel to or from Memphis for such activities.</p>
<p>b. The Company shall reimburse an Association member of the SIG or PSIT, consistent with Company policy and subject to approval by the SIG Chairman, for reasonable expenses related to such member’s SIG/PSIT duties, including, but not limited to, hotels, telephone calls, high speed internet access, transportation (car rental), and meals.</p>
<p>3.   Reviewers</p>
<p>The MEC Scheduling Chairman shall have the ability to utilize designated pilots to review the preliminary and final pairings. Unless otherwise agreed by the MEC Scheduling Chairman and the SIG Chairman, the number of reviewers shall be limited to 5 per base.</p>
<p>4.   Training of SIG/PSIT Members</p>
<p>The Company shall reimburse pilots for training required to be a SIG/PSIT member. Reimbursable training is two full build weeks per trainee. Unless otherwise agreed by the Company, reimbursable training shall be limited to a maximum of two PSIT members per month with an annual maximum of eight PSIT members.</p>
<p>5.   Unless otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, the parties’ course of dealing with regard to soft parameters, pairing templates, etc. will not change.</p>
