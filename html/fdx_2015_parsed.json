Flying conducted with aircraft at or under 60,000 lbs. MTOGW (commonly referred to as \u201cfeeder flying\u201d) shall not be substituted for Federal Express trunk flying (over 60,000 lbs. MTOGW) so as to cause a furlough of any Federal Express pilot. However, if and to the extent that and for such period of time that the furlough is the result of an act beyond the control of the Company (e.g., FAA grounding of a fleet, etc.), feeder/wet lease flying may be used to replace lost trunk flying. The Company shall not deploy multiple feeder flying in the domestic system to effect an elimination/reduction of the overall flying of an affected aircraft type; however, the Company may use multiple feeders to assume some existing trunk flying when aircraft or lift shortages exist during high volume periods. If feeder flying is substituted for Federal Express trunk flying, any pilots who are assigned a crew position as a result of such substitution (and not due to changes in fleet deployment or composition unrelated to feeder flying such as retirement/replacement of, e.g., B727 aircraft) shall not have their hourly rate of pay reduced.
