<!-- SECTION 1 -->
<div class="four" id="section1" style="clear:both;">
<h1 class="persist-header">Section 1: Recognition, Scope and Successorship</h1>
<p>A.   Recognition</p>
<p>1. In accordance with the National Mediation Board’s certification in case number R-6450 dated October 29, 1996, as transferred from the Fedex Pilots Association to the Air Line Pilots Association (“the Association”) in File No. C-6762/Case No. R-6450, 29 NMB 320 dated May 29, 2002, the Company recognizes the Association as the duly authorized representative for the specific craft or class of flight deck crew members (hereinafter referred to as “pilots”) of the Company covered by the Railway Labor Act (“the RLA”).</p>
<p>2. The Company further recognizes that included in the craft or class represented by the Association in conformity with the RLA are those crewmembers on Foreign Duty Assignment (“FDA”), Special International Bid Award (“SIBA”) and/or any other international assignment, domicile or location manned by pilots on the Federal Express Master Seniority List.</p>
<p>B.   Scope, Operation of Company Aircraft</p>
<p>The Company’s revenue flights (including Company revenue charter flights), conducted with aircraft owned, leased, or operated within the domestic or international operations described below, conducted with aircraft over 60,000 lbs. MTOGW, shall be flown only by pilots whose names appear on the Federal Express Master Seniority List in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.</p>
<p>1. “Domestic flights” are all those Company flights wherein all flight legs within a single pairing originate and terminate at cities located solely within the contiguous 48 states.</p>
<p>2. “International flights” are all Company flights which originate from, terminate in or transit the U.S. or its territories via a location outside the contiguous 48 states. International flights also include all flights conducted by any pilots on the Federal Express Master Seniority List assigned to Foreign Duty Assignment (“FDA”), or Special International Bid Award (“SIBA”).</p>
<p>3. All Domestic and International revenue flights conducted with aircraft that are owned, leased, or operated by the Company, having a MTOGW of greater than 60,000 lbs., and operated pursuant to the Company’s Airline Operating Certificate or any additional Part 121 Airline Operating Certificate obtained by the Company, shall be operated by pilots on the Federal Express Master Seniority List in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. Flying conducted with aircraft at or under 60,000 lbs. MTOGW (commonly referred to as “feeder flying”) shall not be substituted for Federal Express trunk flying (over 60,000 lbs. MTOGW) so as to cause a furlough of any Federal Express pilot. However, if and to the extent that and for such period of time that the furlough is the result of an act beyond the control of the Company (e.g., FAA grounding of a fleet, etc.), feeder/wet lease flying may be used to replace lost trunk flying. The Company shall not deploy multiple feeder flying in the domestic system to effect an elimination/reduction of the overall flying of an affected aircraft type; however, the Company may use multiple feeders to assume some existing trunk flying when aircraft or lift shortages exist during high volume periods. If feeder flying is substituted for Federal Express trunk flying, any pilots who are assigned a crew position as a result of such substitution (and not due to changes in fleet deployment or composition unrelated to feeder flying such as retirement/replacement of, e.g., B727 aircraft) shall not have their hourly rate of pay reduced. This hourly rate protection shall end if a junior pilot is activated into a higher paying crew position that the senior pilot could have bid upon and been awarded, but elected not to do so.</p>
<p>4. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, the Company may continue to interline, co-load, code-share, part charter and enter into block space agreements with other carriers to move freight and service in International (outside the contiguous 48 states) markets as required. Within the Domestic system (the contiguous 48 United States) the use of the above shall be done only: (1) when necessary to expedite or (2) when economically necessary, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.</p>
<p>5. At any time during the year should severe damage or destruction to a hull(s) occur the Company may utilize wet lease on a one for one basis until the lost aircraft is actually replaced in the fleet or for a period of one year, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p>6. The Company may also wet lease a minimum of two aircraft above 60,000 lbs. MTOGW for up to four (4) bid periods per calendar year. At least three (3) of those bid periods shall be consecutive. The Company may elect to divide the fourth bid period of wet leasing into four 7-day parts to use over the course of the year. The Company shall provide a minimum of 30 days’ written notice to the Association of any such wet lease(s). The following conditions shall apply to such wet lease arrangements:</p>
<p>a.   Should a wet lease operation assume flying regularly and historically performed by FedEx crewmembers, as evidenced by the FedEx bid packs, for more than two (2) bid periods in a calendar year, the Company shall pay the Association a sum of money for the period of the wet lease in excess of two (2) bid periods calculated as follows: The average pay for a Federal Express crew complement times the number of regular bid pack credit hours that would have been earned by Federal Express pilots but for the wet lease. This sum shall be calculated after the expiration of the wet lease and shall be distributed to pilots in the manner identified by the Association. Wet leases done in support of charter flying during this four month period shall not be subject to this penalty.</p>
<p>b.   Except for the minimum two aircraft wet leasing referred to above, during the bid periods described in this paragraph, the Company shall not wet lease more than the net gain of trunk aircraft scheduled to be added and brought into service in any calendar year. Should, at the end of the calendar year, the Company actually bring into service fewer trunk aircraft than were scheduled and based on the schedule, the Company wet leased more aircraft than would have been permitted if the scheduled additions were the same as the actual deliveries, then the Company shall pay to the Association the same monies it would have paid the Association as calculated under <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_1B6a" target="_blank">Section 1.B.6.a.</a></p>
<p>c.   Should the Company violate the four bid period restriction, the Company shall pay to the Association the following for each wet lease conducted the greater of the number of block hours scheduled or flown, times 2.0, times the highest hourly rate for a three (3) man crew with fifteen (15) years of pay longevity, in addition to the international override, if any.</p>
<p>7. The Company may enter into wet lease and other agreements with other carriers at any time without penalty or payment to any pilot or the Association in order to deliver freight to cities that cannot be served by Federal Express trunk aircraft because:</p>
<p>a.   The Company does not possess all the requisite regulatory authority (or what authority it does possess is in dispute with any government or any agency thereto), all traffic authority and foreign government approvals/authority, as are necessary to fly the scheduled or required route. Should the Company not possess the requisite regulatory authority at the time of the wet lease, it shall make a good faith effort to acquire that authority.</p>
<p>b.   Foreign government or foreign authorities’ action restricts the use of pilots on the Master Seniority List so as to render the use of FedEx pilots not economically feasible; or</p>
<p>c.   An emergency exists that precludes the Company from utilizing Company aircraft. In the event the Company wet leases aircraft under this provision, the Vice President, Flight Operations, shall notify the Association and crew force through an FCIF as soon as practicable. Routine maintenance problems shall not constitute an emergency.</p>
<p>d.   The utilization of pilots on the Master Seniority List is not, or does not continue to be, economically or operationally feasible given the low freight volume, treaty or regulatory restrictions on the right of the Company to move freight through or beyond certain countries or cities, or remoteness or isolation of the served city to the existing Federal Express international route structure.</p>
<p>8. Should the configuration of a given shipment (certain satellites, aircraft, helicopters, etc.) preclude the Company from using one of its own aircraft, then the Company may enlist the services of another carrier to handle that shipment on a sub-contract basis.</p>
<p>9. The Company shall notify the Association quarterly concerning all wet-leasing done during the preceding three bid periods. The Company shall identify the wet lease operator, the trip(s) flown by same, and the reason and effect on Federal Express crewmembers. The Company shall also meet with the Association on a quarterly basis to discuss wet leasing, fleet acquisition and disposal plans and to share with the Association the additional Federal Express trunk route additions/deletions it anticipates over the next quarter. A standing committee consisting of an equal number of Association and Company representatives shall meet within fifteen (15) days following the end of the calendar quarter to review and discuss these matters.</p>
<p>C.   Parent and Affiliates</p>
<p>Should the parent of the Company (FedEx Corp.) or any subsidiary or Affiliate directly or indirectly controlled by the parent of the Company acquire with the intention of retaining and operating a U.S. certificated air carrier or air operation operating aircraft of over 60,000 lbs. MTOGW, then the acquired carrier’s routes and operation of aircraft above the MTOGW of 60,000 lbs. shall be assumed by the pilots on the FedEx Master Seniority List. If the acquired airline is to be sold in the normal course of business, these seniority-merger provisions do not apply. If FedEx Corp., its subsidiaries or Affiliates retain and operate the acquired airline, the assumption of the acquired flying by Federal Express Master Seniority List pilots shall take place as soon as reasonably practical after either the merger of the acquired carrier’s appropriate pilots (those flying aircraft over 60,000 lbs.) into the Federal Express Master Seniority List in the manner set forth in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_1D3" target="_blank">Section 1.D.3.</a>, or in the event the pilots from the acquired carrier are not intended to be retained, then upon the final regulatory confirmation and transfer of the operating certificates to Federal Express and/or FedEx Corp.</p>
<p>D.   Successorship</p>
<p>1. If another U.S. certificated airline or U.S. certificated air cargo operation acquires all or a substantial portion of the Company’s air operations and as a result pilots on the Federal Express Master Seniority List are to be integrated with pilots on seniority lists at that airline or air cargo operation, the integration of pilot seniority lists shall be governed by the Association’s Merger Policy if the Association represents the airline’s pilots as well as the Federal Express pilots and otherwise by Section 3 and Section 13 of the Allegheny-Mohawk Labor Protective Provisions [as specified in 59 CAB 22 (1972)].</p>
<p>2. This agreement shall be binding upon any successor, including without limitation, any assignee, purchaser, transferee, administrator, receiver, executor, and/or trustee of the Company (hereinafter referred to as a “Successor” to the Company). Neither the Company nor its Affiliates shall consummate a Successor transaction unless the Successor agrees in writing, in advance of executing an agreement to consummate such transaction and as an irrevocable condition of the Successorship transaction, to assume and be bound by the Agreement, to recognize the Association as the representative of the Federal Express pilots and to guarantee that the pilots on the Federal Express Pilots’ Master Seniority List will be employed by the Successor in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. The Successor shall continue to recognize the Association in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_1A" target="_blank">Section 1.A.</a> unless and until the National Mediation Board transfers or extinguishes the Association’s certification following an operational merger. The Successor shall continue to be bound by the Agreement until the terms of the Agreement are modified in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<p>3. Should the Company acquire, merge, or operate another U.S. certificated airline or U.S. certificated air operation that employs pilots who operate aircraft with a MTOGW of greater than 60,000 lbs., then such pilots operating aircraft above 60,000 lbs. MTOGW scheduled to be retained, if any, shall be integrated into the Federal Express Master Seniority List.</p>
<p>4. While the integration of the pilot seniority lists is pending or in process the Company agrees not to divert active and existing flying done by Federal Express pilots to the acquired airline or air cargo operation. This restriction shall not preclude the Company from acting to eliminate redundancies, overlaps of routes/services or similar services/routes provided by both carriers. The Company shall, however, not cause Federal Express pilots to be furloughed, assigned, or downgraded as a direct result of the elimination of these redundancies, or the discontinuance of the overlaps of route/services, or the similar service/routes, and the elimination or discontinuance of redundancies, overlaps or similar service/routes shall, to the extent operationally and economically practical, be accomplished without an elimination of or a reduction in flights operated by pilots on the Master Seniority List.</p>
<p>E.   Expedited Grievance and Arbitration Procedures</p>
<p>Any grievance alleging a violation of the provisions of Section 1 shall be filed in writing with the Vice-President, Labor Relations, within 10 days following the date on which the pilot acquired knowledge or reasonably should have acquired knowledge, of the fact(s) or event(s) giving rise to the grievance. The grievance shall be considered and a decision rendered in accordance with the provisions of Section 20 of this Agreement. The hearing before the Vice-President, Labor Relations shall be conducted within 5 business days following receipt of the grievance, and a decision shall be rendered within 5 business days of the conclusion of the hearing. If the decision of the Vice-President, Labor Relations is not satisfactory to the pilot or the Association, such decision may be appealed to the System Board in the manner set forth in Section 21. The System Board hearing shall be commenced within 30 days after the Vice President’s decision, or on the earliest available date offered by the neutral arbitrator selected by the parties. The parties shall attempt to use Robert Harris as the neutral arbitrator. If Mr. Harris is unavailable, the parties shall select the neutral arbitrator from the panel of arbitrators empowered to hear administrative grievances under Section 20. The parties shall make known to the selected arbitrator the expeditious nature of this arbitration and request a decision in the matter as soon as possible.</p>
<p>F.   Disruption of Company Business</p>
<p>The Company shall not lock out pilots and pilots shall not engage in, cause or support any strike or work stoppage at the Company. In the event of an existing or impending labor dispute involving other represented employees, which is or has the capability of disrupting Company flight operations, the MEC Chairman and the Vice President, Flight Operations or the System Chief Pilot shall consult about what measures, if any, were or would be appropriate for Federal Express to take in light of the situation. The Vice President, Flight Operations or the System Chief Pilot will share the result of those conversations in an FCIF to the crewforce and outline what action(s), if any, the Company will take (or has taken) concerning the possible labor dispute.</p>
<p>In the event of a work stoppage legally authorized under the Railway Labor Act, involving other U.S. employees of the Company, the Vice President, Flight Operations or the System Chief Pilot shall consult with the MEC Chairman concerning the nature of any possible disruptions and the expectations the Company has in light of those anticipated disruptions. Pilots shall not be required to perform work customarily done by the pilots of another U.S. certificated air cargo operation who are engaged in a lawful strike against their employer unless the Company has historically performed and provided such services on that airline’s behalf. In cases where the Company has contracted to conduct training for another carrier’s pilots, Federal Express pilots may refuse to train the other carrier’s pilots if those pilots are strike replacements. Strike replacement pilots are those pilots who are being trained to replace the carrier’s current striking pilots or those pilots (from the other carrier) in training for a new seat position when an imminent pilot strike is threatened. Nothing in this section shall preclude the Association from engaging in self-help activities after the procedures provided by the Railway Labor Act, as amended, for changing the terms of this comprehensive collective bargaining agreement have been exhausted.</p>

<p>3.   A pilot who is in an inactive pay status during an entire bid period shall not have a minimum bid period guarantee for such bid period.</p>
<p>4.   When a pilot returns to active pay status during a bid period for which he was not awarded a bid line (e.g., <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25I1a" target="_blank">Section 25.I.1.a.</a>, Custom lines), his minimum bid period guarantee shall be prorated based on the number of days in which the pilot is in active pay status during that bid period.</p>

When he is activated into his first crew position following initial new hire training, his minimum bid period guarantee shall be prorated based upon the number of days in the bid period following his activation.</p>
<p>6.   Maximum Line Value (MLV)</p>
<p>When <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4A2cx" target="_blank">Section 4.A.2.c.x.</a> is in force, for the purposes of establishing a Maximum Line Value (MLV), the following shall apply:</p>
<p>a. The initial value for a crew position shall be a pilot’s awarded BLG (excluding carryover), plus an additional CH value (that has been designated for that specific crew position) which shall be between 4 and 12 CH.</p>
<p>b. By written agreement of the Vice President, Flight Operations and the FedEx MEC Chairman, MLV may be changed to any value higher than a pilot’s awarded BLG + 12:00 CH. The timing of any change in MLV shall be as agreed upon by the VP and the MEC Chairman.</p>
<p>c. Administration of MLV</p>
<p>i.   Prior to open time release, a pilot’s line, including carry-in, shall be limited to MLV.</p>
<p>ii.  Carry-in CH and activities removed due to vacation, count toward MLV. Recurrent training pay does not count towards MLV, except where designated in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E4biv" target="_blank">Section 25.E.4.b.iv.</a> for secondary line awardees.</p>
<p>iii. If, after processing conflicts, a pilot’s awarded line exceeds MLV, the following shall occur:</p>
<p>(a)    During the bid period processing conflict window, the pilot shall have the ability to drop activities in order to bring his line within the MLV drop range. The process for doing so shall be as follows:</p>
<p>(1)  A pilot shall have the ability to drop a trip(s)/R-day block(s) from his line, provided that the value of his line after the adjustment, is within the MLV drop range.</p>
<p>(2)  If a pilot is unable to bring his line within the MLV drop range, the pilot shall have the ability to drop a trip(s)/R-day block(s) until the drop(s) would bring his line below the MLV drop range.</p>
<p>(3)  Ordinarily, activities scheduled in whole or in part on the following days (i.e., base days): New Year’s Eve, New Year’s Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve, or Christmas Day will not be dropped.</p>
<p>(b)    If the application of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4A6ciiia" target="_blank">Section 4.A.6.c.iii.(a)</a> does not result in an MLV-compliant line (e.g., not enough CH dropped, submission for dropping activities over holiday, no combination of activities that meet the MLV drop range), the Company shall drop activities, as necessary, to bring his line within the MLV drop range. If it is not possible to drop activities that bring a pilot’s line within the MLV drop range, then activities shall be dropped to bring the pilot’s line below MLV by the least amount possible. If the only means of bringing a pilot’s line below MLV is to drop a trip or activity scheduled in whole or in part on the following days: New Year’s Eve, New Year’s Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve or Christmas Day; whether to drop that activity shall be at the Company’s discretion.</p>
<p>(c)    All activities dropped due to MLV shall be treated as <br/>
            carry-in conflicts and shall be eligible for phase-in make up, subject to the limitation contained in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4A6ciiid" target="_blank">Section 4.A.6.c.iii.(d).</a> The pilot shall be notified of all trips dropped due to MLV.</p>
<p>(d)    Pilots eligible to participate in the View/Add window may not increase their lines above MLV.</p>
<p>(e)    MLV shall not apply after the release of open time.</p>
<p>B.   Bid Line Guarantee (BLG)</p>
<p>A pilot who is awarded a regular line shall have a BLG equal to the total of the trip guarantees for all trips on the line, excluding that portion of the CH of a carryover trip allocated to the next bid period as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4G" target="_blank">Section 4.G.</a> Prior to any adjustments, however, a BLG shall not be less than the minimum bid period guarantee as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4A1" target="_blank">Section 4.A.1.</a> If the sum of trip guarantees for trips on a pilot’s regular line is less than the minimum bid period guarantee, such pilot’s BLG shall be increased to the minimum bid period guarantee.</p>
<p>C.   Reserve Line Guarantee (RLG) and R-Day Value</p>
<p>A pilot who is awarded a reserve line shall have an RLG equal to the value of an R-day multiplied by the number of R-days scheduled on a reserve line for the bid period package (i.e., up to a maximum of 15, 19, or 23 days). The value of an R-day shall be determined by dividing 96% of the average BLG for regular lines published in the bid period package by the number of R-days scheduled on a reserve line for the bid period package and then rounding that amount to the nearest minute. Prior to any adjustments, however, an RLG shall not be less than the minimum bid period guarantee as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4A1" target="_blank">Section 4.A.1.</a></p>
<p>D.   Mini-RLG</p>
<p>If a pilot’s schedule has both trips and R-days in the same bid period (i.e., secondary, or custom line, or carryover R-days), the following shall apply:</p>
<p>1.   The value of all such R-days shall comprise a mini-RLG. Credit hour accrual for assignments on such R-days shall be the same as for a regular RLG.</p>
<p>2.   CH earned prior to an R-day shall apply toward reserve leveling.</p>
<p>3.   CH earned in reserve status in excess of a pilot’s mini-RLG shall be paid in addition to his BLG as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4H7" target="_blank">Section 4.H.7.</a> (100% up to RLG, 150% for CH over RLG).</p>
<p>E.   Secondary and Custom Line Guarantee</p>
<p>1. Secondary Line Guarantee</p>
<p>Once constructed, a secondary line shall have a BLG or RLG as follows:</p>
<p>a.   A secondary line comprised entirely of trips shall have a BLG computed as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4B" target="_blank">Section 4.B.</a></p>
<p>b.   A secondary line comprised of trips and R-days shall have a BLG equal to the sum of the trip guarantees (for trips scheduled on the line) and R-day values (for R-days scheduled on the line). Prior to any adjustments, however, the BLG shall not be less than the minimum bid period guarantee (as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4A1" target="_blank">Section 4.A.1.</a>). The CH of a carryover trip shall be allocated between bid periods as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4G" target="_blank">Section 4.G.</a> The CH of a carryover R-day(s) shall be allocated to the subsequent bid period.</p>
<p>c.   A secondary line comprised entirely of R-days shall have an RLG computed as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4C" target="_blank">Section 4.C.</a></p>
<p>d. Considering regular and secondary lines together, the spread between the high and low line in a given crew position shall not exceed 13 CH.</p>
<p>2. [Reserved]</p>
<p>3. Custom Line Guarantee</p>
<p>a.   If a pilot is assigned a custom line (as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25I" target="_blank">Section 25.I.</a>), and he does not otherwise have a BLG/RLG for the bid period, he shall have a BLG/RLG for his custom line computed as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4B" target="_blank">Section 4.B.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4C" target="_blank">C.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4E1b" target="_blank">E.1.b.</a>, as applicable.

<p>b.   If a pilot is assigned a custom line (as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25I" target="_blank">Section 25.I.</a>), and he has a BLG/RLG for the bid period (e.g., pay only line), his BLG/RLG for the bid period shall be the greater of his original BLG/RLG or the BLG/RLG for his assigned custom line computed as provided in Section 4.E.3.a.</p>
<p>F.   Trip Guarantee</p>
<p>1. A pilot’s trip guarantee shall be the scheduled credit hour (SCH) value of the trip when the trip is awarded/assigned to the pilot (e.g., bid award, trip trade, open time assignment) or when the pilot blocks out on the trip, whichever is greater. The credit hour (CH) value for a trip is computed as the higher of:</p>
<p>a.   Trip rig, plus revenue block hours in excess of 10 hours in any duty period; or</p>
<p>b.   The sum of the credit hour values of the duty periods. The credit hour value of each duty period is computed as the highest of:</p>
<p>i. minimum pay per duty period (MPDP); or</p>

<p>Duty periods during a trip, when such trip contains at least one layover, shall have an MPDP-1 of 3 CH.</p>
<p>ii.    MPDP-2</p>
<p>A duty period comprised exclusively of a trip which departs and returns to base in the same duty period shall have an MPDP-2 of 6 CH.</p>
<p>iii.   MPDP-E</p>
<p>A duty period which operates into and out of a designated MPDP-E sort facility shall have an MPDP-E of 6 CH when the duty period neither originated nor terminated at base.</p>
<p>iv.    MPDP-F</p>
<p>The final duty period of a trip, which is comprised of revenue flying then deadhead to base, shall have an MPDP-F of 9 CH when:</p>
<p>(a)  the flight sequence originates at a layover city; and</p>
<p>(b)  operates to a designated sort facility; and</p>
<p>(c)  transits such facility and operates to another city; and</p>
<p>(d)  transits such city and concludes with a deadhead by air to base.</p>
<p>v.   Designated Sort Facilities</p>
<p>For MPDP-E and MPDP-F, the designated sort facilities are MEM, IND, EWR, OAK, ORD, AFW, GSO, LAX, ANC, CAN, CDG and any additional sort facilities so designated by agreement between the SIG and the Vice President, Flight Operations. The primary sort facility for an FDA shall be the designated sort facility for purposes of MPDP-E and MPDP-F on such trips.</p>
<p>c.   Block Hours</p>
<p>Block hours are computed as 1 CH for each 1 hour from block-out to block-in computed on a minute by minute basis.</p>
<p>d.   Duty Rig</p>
<p>i. Domestic Day Duty Rig</p>
<p>Duty rig is computed as 1 CH for each 2.0 hours on duty within a single duty period, rounded to the nearest minute, when that duty period has a showtime between the hours of 0500 and 1559 LBT.</p>
<p>ii.    Domestic Night Duty Rig</p>
<p>Duty rig is computed as 1 CH for each 1.92 hours on duty within a single duty period, rounded to the nearest minute, when that duty period has a showtime between the hours of 1600 and 0059 LBT.</p>
<p>iii.   Domestic Critical Duty Rig</p>
<p>Duty rig is computed as 1 CH for each 1.5 hours on duty within a single duty period, rounded to the nearest minute, when that duty period has a showtime between the hours of 0100 and 0459 LBT.</p>
<p>iv.    International Duty Rig</p>
<p>Duty rig is computed as 1 CH for each 1.92 hours on duty within a single international duty period, rounded to the nearest minute.</p>
<p>G.   Allocation of Carryover</p>
<p>1. Carryover R-Days (into Regular or Reserve Line)</p>
<p>The following shall apply to carryover R-days on which no trip is assigned, for regular and reserve line holders:</p>
<p>a.   Carryover R-day(s) shall have the R-day value for the bid period in which they occur;</p>
<p>b.   If the pilot holds a reserve line in the second bid period, carryover R-days shall be added to the RLG for such bid period;</p>
<p>c.   If the pilot holds a regular line for the second bid period, carryover R-days shall be paid in addition to the BLG for such bid period.</p>
<p>2.    Carryover R-days (into Secondary Line)</p>
<p>A secondary line holder with carryover R-days may designate the amount of his carryover R-day CH to be applied toward the new bid period’s BLG or RLG, as applicable. The default setting shall be 0 (zero) CH applied toward the new bid period’s BLG/RLG. Such designation shall be made during the monthly View/Add window, as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E4biii" target="_blank">Section 25.E.4.b.iii.</a></p>
<p>3. Carryover Trips</p>
<p>a.   The total credit hour value of a carryover trip shall be computed as a single trip as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4F" target="_blank">Section 4.F.</a> (Trip Guarantee).</p>
<p>b.   The total credit hour value for the carryover trip shall be divided between the two bid periods in which the trip occurs as follows:</p>
<p>i. All Trips</p>
<p>(a)  If the trip guarantee for the carryover trip is based on trip rig, the first bid period BLG or RLG shall include trip rig for the portion of the carryover trip scheduled to occur in the first bid period; provided, however, if the last duty period of such trip begins in the first bid period, the first bid period BLG or RLG shall include full trip guarantee.</p>
<p>(b)  If the trip guarantee for the carryover trip is based on the sum of the duty periods, the first bid period BLG or RLG shall include the sum of the credit hour values of duty periods beginning in the first bid period.</p>
<p>ii.    Non-Reserve Trips (Carrying Over into a Regular or Reserve Line)</p>
<p>If the carryover trip was not a reserve trip, then the following shall apply:</p>
<p>(a)  If the pilot holds a BLG in the second bid period, the remainder of trip guarantee for the carryover trip shall be added to such BLG.</p>
<p>(b) If the pilot holds an RLG in the second bid period, the remainder of trip guarantee shall be paid in addition to such RLG, and shall not be credited toward RLG but shall be credited toward leveling.</p>
<p>iii.  Non-Reserve Trips (Carrying Over into a Secondary Line)</p>
<p>If the carryover trip was not a reserve trip, then a secondary line holder may designate the amount of his carryover CH to be applied toward the new bid period’s BLG or RLG, as applicable. If the secondary or custom line holder has a mini-RLG, his designated carryover CH shall not be credited toward mini-RLG or leveling. The default setting shall be 0 (zero) CH applied toward the new bid period’s BLG/RLG. Such designation shall be made during the monthly View/Add window, as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E4biii" target="_blank">Section 25.E.4.b.iii.</a></p>
<p>iv.    Reserve Trips (Carrying Over into a Regular or Reserve Line)</p>
<p>If the carryover trip was a reserve trip, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>(a)  If the pilot holds a BLG in the second bid period, his carryover R-days shall constitute a mini-RLG for the second bid period. The remainder of trip guarantee for the carryover trip shall be credited toward mini-RLG and leveling.</p>
<p>(b) If the pilot holds an RLG in the second bid period, the remainder of trip guarantee shall be credited toward such RLG and leveling.</p>
<p>v.  Reserve Trips (Carrying Over into a Secondary Line)</p>
<p>If the carryover trip was a reserve trip, a secondary line holder shall be afforded the same designation opportunity and default as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4G3biii" target="_blank">Section 4.G.3.b.iii.</a> above. If the secondary line holder has a BLG with mini-RLG in the second bid period, his carryover R-days shall be added to the mini-RLG for the second bid period. His designated carryover CH, if any, shall be credited toward mini-RLG and leveling.</p>
<p>c.   Notwithstanding other provisions of this paragraph, compensation for carryover trips flown in VLT/DRF/CMU status shall be paid on the 15th of the month following the bid period in which the trip originated; provided, however, that overage accrued on such trips shall be paid on the 15th of the month following the bid period in which the trip terminated.</p>
<p>H.   Reserve Credit Hour Accrual</p>
<p>1. A pilot who is assigned a trip(s) or base standby in reserve status shall have the trip guarantee or standby pay credited toward his leveling and/or RLG as follows:</p>
<p>a.   For leveling, trip guarantee or standby pay shall be credited upon assignment.</p>

<p>c.   If a pilot’s recurrent training is scheduled as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25C12diiib" target="_blank">Section 25.C.12.d.iii.(b)</a>, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>i. If a pilot is removed from a trip(s) for which he has trip guarantee, due to a conflict with recurrent training, he shall earn the trip guarantee for that trip(s).

<p>iii.   If a pilot attends recurrent training on a scheduled day off, or on a combination of days off and trip days, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>(a)  if no trip was removed due to recurrent training or minimum days off, the pilot shall be compensated 4:30 CH per day, in addition to BLG/RLG, except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4I7" target="_blank">Section 4.I.7.</a></p>
<p>(b)  if a trip was removed due to recurrent training or minimum days off, and the total number of training days exceeds the number of trip days removed, the excess days shall be compensated at 4:30 CH per day.</p>

<p>(b)  if the pilot has waived his minimum days off protection, no R-day shall be removed from his line and he shall earn 4:30 CH in addition to his RLG.</p>
<p>d. A pilot who completes distance learning-based training shall earn 1 CH for each 2 scheduled hours of that training, or portion thereof. That compensation shall be in addition to BLG/RLG.</p>
<p>5. Initial, Transition, Upgrade (ITU) Training Pay</p>
<p>a.   A pilot in ITU training for an upgrade award or as a result of a crew position assignment shall earn a minimum of his BLG/RLG, adjusted as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4I1" target="_blank">Section 4.I.1.</a> (Phase-In Conflict), excluding carryover CH. If he does not have a BLG/RLG (e.g., returning from a leave of absence), he shall be assigned a prorated RLG (4 days of work for every 7 days available) for his crew position based on the number of days he is in active pay status during the remainder of the bid period.</p>
<p>b. For any bid period not completely covered by a pilot’s ITU footprint, in which the pilot is awarded a secondary line, the value of his ITU to be applied toward his BLG/RLG shall be a prorated portion of the credit hour value of average BLG for his crew position. This pro-ration shall be calculated by dividing the number of days underneath his ITU footprint, in the bid period, by the total number of days in the bid period (28, 35, or 42), rounded to the nearest whole number.</p>
<p>c.   A pilot in ITU training for a lateral or down bid, other than a pilot who was assigned into that crew position, shall be awarded a line in pay only status. The pilot shall not be compensated for any carryover CH on his pay only line.</p>
<p>d.    A pilot in ITU training will only be compensated for the carryover credit hours he actually flies and any remaining carryover credit hours shall be eligible for make-up.</p>

<p>i. the pilot’s pay only line; or</p>
<p>ii.    the higher of SCH or ACH for OE trips, plus 4:30 CH for each day the pilot received or showed for scheduled training other than OE.</p>
<p>6. Requalification Training Pay</p>

<p>7. Pay Following Training Failure</p>
<p>a.   If a pilot incurs a training failure, he shall continue to receive compensation as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4I4" target="_blank">Section 4.I.4.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4I5" target="_blank">I.5.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4I6" target="_blank">I.6.</a> (recurrent, ITU or requalification training) as applicable, except that he shall not be compensated for any subsequent training on a scheduled day off.</p>
<p>b.   A pilot awarded or assigned a lower-paying crew position, whose activation is delayed owing to his performance or unavailability (e.g., leave of absence, sick leave), will begin to earn the lower hourly rate of pay 90 days following the pilot’s awarded/assigned training start date, unless his actual activation is sooner.</p>
<p>8. Bereavement Pay</p>
<p>A pilot removed from a trip(s) or R-day(s), as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25Z" target="_blank">Section 25.Z</a>. (Bereavement Absence), shall be compensated for the portion of such activities in actual conflict with the bereavement absence as follows:</p>
<p>a.   If an R-day conflicts with a bereavement absence, an R-day value shall be credited toward leveling and RLG.</p>
<p>b. If an entire trip conflicts with a bereavement absence, the pilot shall earn trip guarantee.</p>
<p>c. If a portion of a trip conflicts with a bereavement absence, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>i.   the pilot shall be paid for any portion of the trip which he actually operated; and</p>
<p>ii.  the pilot shall be paid for other portions of the trip that conflict with bereavement absence; and</p>
<p>iii.   The CH remainder of trip guarantee (i.e., that part not compensated as bereavement pay, and not actually operated), multiplied by 100, 125, or 150%, as applicable, based on the trip’s assignment code shall be:</p>
<p>(a)    Charged to the pilot’s sick bank; or</p>

<p>(c)    If the pilot requests, deducted from his BLG, and be eligible for make-up.</p>
<p>9. Training Support Pay</p>
<p>a. If a pilot is scheduled to occupy a crew seat in support of another pilot’s simulator training (or aircraft/FTD training in lieu thereof) on an R-day, at his base, he shall be credited R-day value toward his leveling upon assignment and credited toward RLG if he shows for such assignment. The pilot will have an R-day value deducted from his RLG, and receive no leveling credit, if he no-shows such assignment.</p>
<p>b.   If a pilot, other than a pilot on an R-day, occupies a crew seat in support of another pilot’s simulator training (or aircraft/FTD training in lieu thereof) he shall earn 4:30 CH in addition to his BLG/RLG. If the pilot is a VLT/DRF/CMU pilot, such compensation shall be at 150% of his normal pay rate.</p>
<p>10.    Military Absence</p>
<p>A pilot’s BLG/RLG shall be reduced by the value of any trip(s) and/or R-day(s) dropped due to military obligations. Such pilot shall be eligible for make-up. A pilot is eligible to use available vacation CH to cover trip days in actual conflict with his military obligations. A pilot’s use of vacation CH for military obligations shall not create a deficit in his vacation bank.</p>
<p>J.   Effect of Line Revisions Prior to the Start of a Bid Period</p>
<p>If the Company revises a regular line following publication of a bid period package but prior to the close of the bidding for that bid period, the following shall apply:</p>

<p>2.   The line shall be awarded as revised at the time the bid closes.</p>
<p>3.   The BLG for that line shall be the higher of BLG as originally published or as revised at the time the bid closes.</p>
<p>K.   Correction of BLG/RLG Errors</p>
<p>1. If a line is published with a miscalculated BLG, the pilot awarded that line shall receive the higher of the published or the correctly calculated BLG, except that a pilot awarded a line with a BLG published as higher than the maximum permissible under line construction rules shall earn the highest BLG permissible under such rules.</p>
<p>2. The published RLG for a bid period package shall be revised to correct clerical or calculation errors.</p>
<p>L.   Substitution</p>
<p>1. A pilot’s substitution guarantee shall be the sum of all CH earned in substitution status (i.e., availability credits, airport hold credits, substitution base standby credits and pay for a substitution trip). A pilot shall earn trip guarantee for a substitution trip only if he blocks out on such trip. As provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H3bii" target="_blank">Section 25.H.3.b.ii.</a>, if a pilot’s substitution window is greater than 72 hours, and the pilot chooses not to remain eligible for substitution at 4 hours after showtime of the trip that caused substitution eligibility, he shall be paid 18 CH toward trip guarantee and is eligible for OTP for the balance of trip guarantee.</p>
<p>2. If a pilot becomes eligible for substitution, he shall be compensated as follows:</p>
<p>a.   If the pilot accepts all substitution assignments and fulfills all availability requirements (as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H3" target="_blank">Section 25.H.3.</a>), he shall earn the greater of the trip guarantee for the original trip or substitution guarantee, provided, however, that a pilot shall not earn more than the trip guarantee for his original trip unless the value of the substitution assignments he performs (i.e., trips, standbys and airport holds) is greater than original trip guarantee; or</p>
<p>b.   If the pilot forfeits trip guarantee (e.g., by refusing a substitution assignment or failing to remain available for contact), and neither accepts a reassignment trip nor enters OTP, he shall earn substitution guarantee only; or</p>
<p>c.   If the pilot accepts a reassignment trip, he shall earn reassignment trip pay as determined by <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H10" target="_blank">Section 25 H.10.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4M" target="_blank">Section 4.M.</a>; or</p>
<p>d.   If the pilot enters OTP, he shall earn compensation as determined by <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4N" target="_blank">Section 4.N.</a>; and</p>
<p>e.   A pilot shall not earn both assignment trip CH and substitution availability CH during the same day of substitution eligibility.</p>
<p>3. If a pilot initially eligible for substitution remains available as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H3b" target="_blank">Section 25.H.3.b.</a> through H.3.e., (availability periods), he shall receive 6 CH toward his substitution guarantee for each availability period if:</p>
<p>a.   during that availability period, he was not offered a substitution trip; or</p>
<p>b.   during that availability period, he did not reject a substitution trip; and</p>
<p>c.   the availability period was not entirely contained within the 72 hours in which no substitution assignment can begin as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H3bii" target="_blank">Section 25.H.3.b.ii.</a></p>
<p>4. If a pilot is held for 4 hours at the airport following removal from his original or substitution trip, and does not block out on a substitution trip during that 4 hour window, he shall earn 6 CH credit toward his substitution guarantee.</p>
<p>5. If a pilot forfeits trip guarantee, he shall be eligible to make-up the value of his original trip guarantee less CH earned in OTP (if the pilot is in OTP) or his substitution guarantee (if the pilot is not in OTP).</p>
<p>6. If a pilot is eligible for substitution due to recurrent training, the recurrent training pay provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4I4ciii" target="_blank">Section 4.I.4.c.iii.</a> shall be credited toward his substitution guarantee.</p>
<p>M.   Reassignment Trip Pay</p>
<p>1. If a pilot accepts a reassignment trip he shall be compensated the higher of trip guarantee for the original trip(s) calculated at 100% of his normal pay rate, or trip guarantee for the reassignment trip calculated at 125% of that rate, if:</p>
<p>a.   he blocks out on the reassignment trip; or</p>
<p>b.   he becomes eligible for substitution based on his reassignment trip; or</p>
<p>c.   the Company removes him from his reassignment trip for operational reasons (e.g., to replace a high minimums pilot).</p>
<p>2. If a pilot trades his reassignment trip, he shall earn only the trip guarantee for the trip(s) assumed as a result of the trade.</p>
<p>3. If a pilot does not block out on a reassignment trip due to illness or injury, he shall be compensated the trip guarantee of the reassignment trip (at 100% of his normal pay rate), and his sick bank shall be charged accordingly.</p>
<p>N.   PMU (Priority Make Up) Trip Pay</p>
<p>1.    A pilot in OTP shall be pay protected for the trip guarantee of his original trip for the remainder of the bid period in which the trip began plus three additional bid periods thereafter. The trip guarantee for his original trip shall then be deducted from his first paycheck after the pay protection ends (and subsequent paychecks if necessary).</p>
<p>2. If a pilot is assigned an OTP trip, he shall earn trip guarantee.</p>
<p>3. CH for trips assigned in OTP status shall be compensated at 125% of the pilot’s normal pay rate, except that CH earned for trips assigned in OTP status, which exceed the pilot’s OTP eligibility shall be compensated at 100%.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>A 12 CH trip and an 18 CH trip become eligible for substitution. The pilot holding those trips elects OTP and therefore has an OTP eligibility of 30 CH. The pilot flies a 24 CH trip in OTP status. These CH are paid at 125%. With 6 hours of OTP eligibility remaining (and before that eligibility expires), the pilot flies a 9 CH trip in OTP status. Six of these CH are paid at 125% and the other 3 CH are paid at 100%.</p>
<p>O.   Base Standby Pay</p>
<p>1. A pilot on base airport or base hotel standby shall be guaranteed an R-day value, except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4O2" target="_blank">Section 4.O.2.</a> below.</p>
<p>2. If a pilot eligible for substitution is assigned a base standby (as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H5d" target="_blank">Section 25.H.5.d.</a>), and does not block-out on a trip, he shall be credited with 6 CH towards his substitution guarantee. If he blocks out on a trip, he shall be compensated the greater of trip guarantee for such trip or substitution availability credit.</p>
<p>3. If a pilot on base airport standby blocks out on a trip, he shall earn the trip guarantee for that trip, with the calculation of MPDP and duty rig beginning at showtime of the standby period.</p>
<p>4. If a pilot on base hotel standby blocks out on a trip, he shall earn the trip guarantee for that trip.</p>
<p>P.   Make-Up Pay</p>

<p>1. If a pilot is assigned a make-up trip, other than make-up sick or make-up vacation, he shall earn trip guarantee.</p>
<p>2. Make-Up Sick (MUS), Make-Up Disability (MUD) and Make-Up Vacation (MUV)</p>
<p>a.   If a pilot is assigned a MUS, MUD or MUV trip, he shall earn trip guarantee if he blocks out on such trip.</p>
<p>b.   If a pilot is removed from a MUS, MUD or MUV trip prior to block-out, he shall be credited as follows:</p>
<p>i.  If he is removed via VIPS more than 3:00 hours prior to his scheduled showtime, he shall receive no credit for that trip.</p>

<p>2. If a duty period qualifies for extra duty period pay, no disruptions (except for the disruption due to a deadhead at the end of a trip being revised to operate, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25S2bii" target="_blank">Section 25.S.2.b.ii.</a>), are payable based on events that occurred during that duty period.</p>
<p>3. For purposes of determining extra duty period pay, a standby period(s) that is part of a multiple day trip, but is not attached to a duty period scheduled to contain flying shall count as one duty period.

<p>7. If a trip extends more than 2 hours into time scheduled free from duty at base, overage compensation for the first 12 CH shall be paid at 150% of the pilot’s normal pay rate. If a pilot earns more than 12 CH of overage on a trip, the excess shall be paid at 200% of the pilot’s normal pay rate.</p>

<p>b.   If a reserve trip extends more than 2 hours into time scheduled free from duty at base on a non R-day, overage CH shall be computed as trip rig for the period from scheduled trip termination until actual trip termination. Overage CH shall be applied as follows:</p>
<p>i. CH accrued on an R-day shall be applied toward leveling and credited toward RLG at 100%.</p>
<p>ii.    CH accrued on time scheduled free from duty on a non R-day shall be applied toward leveling only at 100% and shall be compensated in addition to BLG/RLG at 150% of the pilot’s normal pay rate.</p>

<p>b.   If a substitution trip extends more than 2 hours beyond the scheduled termination of the pilot’s original trip, into time scheduled free from duty at base, overage shall be computed as trip rig for the period from scheduled termination of the substitution trip until actual termination of that trip. Overage CH shall be applied as follows:</p>
<p>i. Overage CH accrued, if any, from the scheduled termination of the substitution trip until the scheduled termination of the original trip shall be credited toward trip guarantee of the original trip at 100%.</p>
<p>ii.    Overage CH accrued from scheduled termination of the original trip until actual termination of the substitution trip shall be compensated at 150% of the pilot’s normal pay rate.</p>

<p>5. The Company shall pay for a pilot’s hotel room, tax, access charges related to phone calls (local and long distance), and business related telephone calls. All other incidental charges shall be paid by the pilot when checking out. The Company shall arrange direct billing for all designated facilities, and, if possible, for unscheduled accommodations. The pilot shall ensure that the direct bill for his stay includes only expenses that qualify for reimbursement (e.g., no long distance personal calls on direct bill).</p>

Credit for the cancelation shall be as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_8C2h" target="_blank">Section 8.C.2.h.</a> If, having canceled his hotel room, a pilot’s personal plans change and he needs a hotel room as originally scheduled, he may either re-book his original hotel room, or if unavailable, obtain a hotel room in the same city and be reimbursed for such room up to the contract hotel rate. CRS shall re-book the pilot’s room, (subject to availability), at that city’s contract hotels only, when Company schedule changes or operational delays are the reason for the pilot’s change of plans. If the pilot stays in a hotel room, as provided in this paragraph, other than after a revenue trip, he shall notify CRS of his contact numbers. This hotel room shall be paid for using the Company issued Travel Card, unless CRS advises the pilot of a direct billing arrangement at a contract hotel. This hotel room shall not be charged to the pilot’s deviation bank, and shall be documented by the submission of an expense report.</p>
<p>8. If the Company becomes aware of circumstances at a hotel property that could preclude pilots from receiving adequate rest (e.g., public demonstration, labor actions), the Company shall attempt to minimize or eliminate the potential disruption (e.g., by relocating pilots, etc.).</p>

<p>11.    Third Party Home Purchase Plan</p>
<p>a.   This benefit is provided to assist a pilot in the sale of his current residence. A pilot is required to use the marketing assistance program before this benefit is utilized. A pilot must request the third party purchase plan within 4 months of his activation date. The property must be a single family dwelling or a condominium, located in the United States, which the pilot owns and which is his permanent residence, and which is not a mobile home or boat. The property must not contain unacceptable levels of radon gas (EPA guidelines used). The Company shall reasonably determine the eligibility of the property to be purchased for purposes of the application of this paragraph.</p>
<p>b.   This plan shall provide two independent, professional appraisals to determine the current market value of the property, which shall become the purchase price of the home. Current market value shall be determined by averaging the two appraisals. If, however, the two appraisals differ by more than 5% of the lower appraisal, the third party relocation company shall obtain a third appraisal and market value shall then be determined by averaging the two closest appraisals. The appraisers shall be selected by the pilot from a list of five provided by the Company. Fewer appraisers may be listed in the event that less than five certified appraisers are available in a particular real estate market. The Company shall notify the pilot of the purchase amount, and the pilot shall have 45 days from notification to accept the purchase price. If the pilot accepts that price, the third party company shall purchase the residence at the values established herein and handle all paperwork related to the closing. The pilot and his immediate family must be prepared to vacate their residence within 60 days after accepting the offer.</p>

<p>However, if he upgrades to a new crew status at the same FDA location, his 3 year commitment shall be increased by the period of time the pilot is unavailable for line flying due to his training for the new crew status.

Notwithstanding the provisions of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_6E4a" target="_blank">Section 6.E.4.a.</a> through E.4.d., the weight limitation for a pilot leaving an FDA shall not be less than the amount originally shipped to the FDA plus the increase provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_6E4d" target="_blank">Section 6.E.4.d.</a></p>
<p>f.   The Company shall reimburse a pilot (if goods were stored by the pilot without the Company’s assistance) or pay the cost for the storage (if the goods were handled by the Company or its vendor) of a reasonable amount of household goods for the duration of the FDA assignment, plus 90 days. The payment of storage costs shall end if the pilot no longer holds a crew position at the FDA or if the pilot relocates outside the acceptable radius for that base (even if he still holds a crew position at the FDA).</p>
<p>g.   The Company shall allow up to three additional space-available personal shipments over the course of the FDA assignment from the storage facility to the residence at the FDA; provided, however, that one of the additional shipments (not to exceed 1,000 pounds) may be from a location other than the storage facility. Goods shipped from the storage facility must be goods that have been stored at that facility at the Company’s cost, whether directly, or by reimbursement to the pilot. Additional shipments may not exceed a total weight of 3,000 pounds, cumulative. Eligibility for the additional shipments commences on the first anniversary of the completion of the relocation to the FDA at 1,000 pounds with each additional 1,000 pounds accruing on the second and third anniversaries, respectively. In addition, the Company shall also allow a personal shipment of up to 100 pounds per month over the course of the FDA assignment, with the ability of the pilot to rollover any unused monthly shipment(s) in previous months to subsequent months up to a total of 2,000 pounds; provided, however, that the shipping limit shall be reset to zero on January 1 of each year. A pilot shall have until January 31 to use the accrued, but unused, balance from the previous year.</p>
<p>h.   A pilot shall be responsible for all customs charges associated with his move to and from the FDA.</p>
<p>i.   The Company shall reimburse a pilot up to a cumulative total of $1,000 for the transportation of pets.</p>
<p>F.   Relocation Days Off</p>
<p>1. Any pilot eligible for and exercising a Company paid relocation pursuant to Section 6 shall be entitled to a certain number of days off in order to assist in that relocation. The number of days off is based on the following formula:</p>
<p>a.   For domestic moves (including Anchorage, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico):</p>
<p>i. time off is equal to the lesser of the distance between the old and new domicile or actual residence and new domicile, divided by 400 if driving, or 800 if flying; and</p>
<p>ii.    the result is rounded to the next highest whole number, if <br/>
        applicable.</p>
<p>b.   For FDA moves pursuant to <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_6E" target="_blank">Section 6.E.</a>, either to or from the FDA, the pilot shall receive 7 days off.</p>
<p>2. The total number of days off provided by the formula may be split into 2 periods.</p>
<p>3. The pilot shall be compensated an R-day value for each trip day or R-day that is dropped (without pay) as a relocation day under <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_6F" target="_blank">Section 6.F.</a> Relocation days that occur on days off shall not be compensated.</p>
<p>4. Credit Hours lost from a pilot’s BLG/RLG as a result of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_6F" target="_blank">Section 6.F.</a> shall be eligible for make-up.</p>
<p>5. A pilot eligible for a relocation package shall coordinate in advance with his Fleet Captain(s) the days off for relocation.</p>
<p>6. Days off for relocation also apply to pilots taking either of the crash pad move options as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_6D2" target="_blank">Section 6.D.2.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_6D3" target="_blank">D.3.</a></p>
<p>7. A pilot changing to a geographically different base, who is not entitled to a relocation package, shall request and coordinate with his Fleet Captain(s) any schedule that involves dropping activities without pay to facilitate such change of base.</p>
<p>G.   General</p>
<p>1. A relocation request form shall be submitted to Human Resources, AOD, to initiate benefit eligibility.</p>
<p>2. A pilot shall advise Human Resources, AOD, in writing of the completion of his relocation. His relocation is complete when he has established a new permanent residence for himself and, if applicable, his spouse, and/or his dependent children, within the acceptable radius of his base within 18 months following his activation date or the Company’s first expenditures on the pilot’s relocation, whichever is earlier. The Company shall verify completion of a pilot’s relocation based on objective factors.</p>
<p>3. Based on a review of all the circumstances, Human Resources, AOD, may determine that a pilot has completed his relocation even though some of the factors ordinarily establishing a completed relocation are absent. If the pilot subsequently fails to complete his relocation, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_6G2" target="_blank">Section 6.G.2.</a>, the pilot shall be deemed never to have relocated and shall be obligated to reimburse the Company in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_6B8" target="_blank">Section 6.B.8.</a></p>
<p>4. The Company may request documentation to establish that a pilot has completed his relocation, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_6G2" target="_blank">Section 6.G.2.</a> The documentation may include, but is not limited to, settlement statements relating to the purchase and/or sale of residences; verification of the movement of household goods and automobile(s) to the new location; verification of the permanent relocation of the pilot; verification of the permanent relocation of the pilot’s spouse; verification of the permanent relocation of the pilot’s dependent children under the age of 18 years; establishment of a pilot’s residence at the new location for purposes of applicable property or state income taxes, driver’s license, automobile registration and voter’s registration. A pilot shall submit documentation requested by the Company in accordance with this paragraph.</p>
<p>5. If a pilot becomes obligated to reimburse the Company for expenditures related to relocation, he may request of Human Resources, AOD, a repayment schedule based on a mutually agreeable per pay check amount. If the parties are unable to agree on an amount to be deducted per pay check, the Company is authorized to initiate a payroll deduction as provided in Section <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_3E1avi" target="_blank">3.E.1.a.vi.</a> Unless mutually waived by both the pilot and Human Resources, AOD, the maximum period allowed for repayment under this provision shall not exceed nine (9) months.</p>
<p>6. Notwithstanding the provisions of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_6G5" target="_blank">Section 6.G.5.</a>, if a pilot’s obligation to reimburse the Company for expenditures related to relocation becomes the subject of a grievance filed pursuant to Section 20, the period contained in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_6G5" target="_blank">Section 6.G.5.</a> shall not commence until final resolution of that grievance pursuant to Sections 20 and 21.</p>
<p>7. A pilot’s eligibility for staging jumpseat travel status as a pilot commuting to and from work at his new base expires 30 days following his receipt of the full relocation allowance provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_6C2" target="_blank">Section 6.C.2.</a></p>
<p>8. The Company may extend any of the time limits contained in Section 6 on a non-precedential basis. A pilot’s request for such extension shall be submitted in writing to Human Resources, AOD, and shall contain a complete description of the reasons for which the extension is requested. The request shall be made prior to the expiration of the applicable time limit and shall not be unreasonably denied.</p>
<p>9. Notwithstanding other provisions in this Section, if a pilot is forced to leave his current geographic domicile (or base in the case of an FDA), due to legal restrictions, furlough, or assignment (as defined by Section 24) such pilot shall not incur any reimbursement obligations pursuant to this Section. Additionally, a pilot (including those pilots subject to the FDA LOA, ANC LOA, etc.) who exercises an Assignment Right of Return (ARR), as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24C2e" target="_blank">Section 24.C.2.e.</a>, shall not incur any reimbursement obligations pursuant to this Section.</p>

<!-- SECTION 7 -->
<div class="four" id="section7">
<h1 class="persist-header">Section 7: Vacation</h1>
<p>A.   General</p>
<p>1. A pilot shall receive 6 CH for each day of accrued vacation.</p>
<p>2. A vacation day shall be a 24 hour period corresponding to the local base day. A vacation period is a series of consecutive days posted and awarded as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7C" target="_blank">Section 7.C.</a>, and rescheduled, if applicable, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7A9" target="_blank">Section 7.A.9.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7E" target="_blank">7.E.</a></p>
<p>3. A pilot may not be assigned a trip in conflict with his vacation period.</p>
<p>4. A pilot shall not be permitted to trip trade into, out of, or within his vacation period.</p>
<p>5. A pilot must have a vacation credit hour bank balance greater than zero to take a vacation period.</p>
<p>6. On the effective date of this Agreement, vacation days previously scheduled or accrued shall be retained.</p>
<p>7. When a pilot’s employment with the Company terminates (including retirement), he shall be compensated for all vacation time accrued and not taken. The amount of this vacation compensation shall be based on the pilot’s last rate of pay and computed at the rate of 6 CH per day. If a pilot has a negative vacation bank balance, his final compensation settlement shall be reduced by his negative vacation bank credit hour balance at his current pay rate.</p>
<p>8. In the event of a pilot’s death, any earned and unused vacation credit shall be paid to his beneficiary or to his estate. If a pilot has a negative vacation bank balance, his estate’s final compensation settlement shall be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>9. In extenuating circumstances, a pilot may request that his flight manager approve an immediate, unscheduled vacation.</p>
<p>10.    For purposes of this Section, a “year” shall be a calendar year.</p>
<p>11. As provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4I10" target="_blank">Section 4.I.10.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_14A7" target="_blank">Section 14.A.7.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25L13d" target="_blank">Section 25.L.13.d.</a> (Emergency Drop), and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25Z3" target="_blank">Section 25.Z.3.</a> (Bereavement Absence), a pilot may use available hours in his vacation bank to cover annual military training, to preclude or delay going on disability, for personal emergencies, and to add additional days for bereavement absence.</p>
<p>B.   Vacation Accrual</p>
<p>1. A pilot shall accrue vacation to be taken in the following calendar year based on his longevity as a pilot as of December 31 of the current calendar year.</p>
<p>a.   A pilot with less than 1 year longevity shall accrue 1.5 days per month for the first 10 months in an active pay status during the year.</p>
<p>b.   A pilot with longevity of at least 1 year, but less than 4 years shall be eligible for 15 days vacation.</p>
<p>c.   A pilot with longevity of at least 4 years, but less than 5 years, shall be eligible for 15 days vacation plus a pro rata share based on his longevity and the pro rata formula in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7B5" target="_blank">Section 7.B.5.</a></p>
<p>d. A pilot with longevity of at least 5 years, but less than 9 years, shall be eligible for 22 days vacation.</p>
<p>e.   A pilot with longevity of at least 9 years, but less than 10 years, shall be eligible for 22 days vacation plus a pro rata share based on his longevity and the pro rata formula in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7B5" target="_blank">Section 7.B.5.</a></p>
<p>f.   A pilot with longevity of at least 10 years, but less than 19 years, shall be eligible for 29 days vacation.</p>
<p>g.   A pilot with longevity of at least 19 years but less than 20 years shall be eligible for 29 days vacation plus a pro rata share based on his longevity and the pro rata formula in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7B5" target="_blank">Section 7.B.5.</a></p>
<p>h. A pilot with longevity of 20 years or more shall be eligible for 36 days vacation.</p>
<p>2. If a pilot does not complete 10 months in an active pay status during a calendar year due to retirement, furlough, disability, or unpaid leave(s) of absence (Section 13), other than leave due to on-the-job injury, he shall not be entitled to the full accrual as per <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7B1" target="_blank">Section 7.B.1.</a> That pilot’s vacation accrual shall be 1/10th of the full accrual for each calendar month the pilot is in an active pay status. For purposes of this paragraph, a month shall be counted if the pilot is not retired, or on furlough, disability or unpaid leave of absence for more than 15 days during that month.</p>
<p>Example-1: A pilot incurs a disabling event on December 31, 1998. He is on sick leave from January 1, 1999 until March 1, at which time his sick bank is exhausted. He is then on disability and returns to active service on June 15. The pilot is in active pay status for 9 months (Jan., Feb., and June through December). His vacation accrual (i.e., to be used in the year 2000), is reduced by 1/10th.</p>
<p>Example-2: A pilot actively flew the line until his retirement on July 29, 1999. Since the pilot completed 7 months in an active pay status in 1999, his vacation accrual for the year 2000 is 70% of his normal full accrual. The pilot will be paid for this vacation after retirement, as part of his 1999 wages.</p>
<p>3. The month in which a pilot is hired shall count for vacation accrual purposes only if his hire date is on or before the 15th day of that month.</p>
<p>4. Fractions of an accrued vacation day shall be rounded to the nearest whole day.</p>
<p>5. Vacation days earned on a pro rata basis (as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7B1c" target="_blank">Section 7.B.1.c.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7B1e" target="_blank">B.1.e.</a>, and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_71g" target="_blank">B.1.g.</a>) shall be computed at a rate of 0.7 days per month for each month of service, up to 10 months per calendar year, subject to the provisions of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7B4" target="_blank">Section 7.B.4.</a></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Hire Date: June 18, 1994</p>
<p>Vacation calendar year 1999 = 15 regular days plus 4 extra days</p>
<p>(6 mos. X 0.7 = 4.2 days rounded to 4 days)</p>
<p>C. Vacation Bidding Procedures</p>
<p>1. Vacation shall not be cumulative and must be taken within the calendar year following the year in which it is earned except for an awarded vacation period which carries from one calendar year into the next, and except as otherwise provided in this Section. Vacation bids shall be awarded on the basis of seniority within each crew position.</p>
<p>2. A pilot’s crew position for a vacation bid shall be the crew position he holds at the close of such bid. However, a pilot who has been awarded, but has not yet been activated in, a new crew position as a result of a base closure shall bid vacation in his new crew position.</p>
<p>3. Vacation shall be bid and awarded as follows:</p>
<p>a. Available 7 day vacation slots for the next year shall be distributed concurrent with the bid period package published closest to August 1. The first vacation bid shall open on the date indicated on each vacation bid pack and close at noon, 14 days later. The first vacation bid awards shall be published 7 days after the first vacation bids have closed.</p>
<p>b. The second vacation bid shall be distributed concurrent with the first bid period package published after the first vacation bid closes. The second vacation bid shall open on the date indicated on each vacation bid pack and close at noon, 14 days later. The second vacation bid awards shall be published 7 days after the second vacation bids have closed.</p>
<p>c. The third vacation bid shall be distributed in the first bid period package published after the second vacation bid closes. The third vacation bid shall open on the date indicated on each vacation bid pack and close at noon, 14 days later. The third vacation bid awards shall be published 7 days after the third vacation bids have closed.</p>
<p>d. The fourth vacation bid shall be distributed in the first bid period package published after the third vacation bid closes. The fourth vacation bid shall open on the date indicated on each vacation bid pack and close at noon, 14 days later. Fourth vacation bid awards shall be published 7 days after the fourth vacation bids have closed.</p>
<p>4. If a pilot fails to submit a bid, or submits an insufficient number of bids, he shall be assigned a vacation period(s) when the fourth vacation bid awards are published.</p>
<p>5. For vacation award purposes, a vacation period that extends into a subsequent vacation slot by 4 or more days shall occupy both slots.</p>
<p>6. A sufficient number of vacation slots shall be available for bid to cover all anticipated vacations in each crew position. Available vacation slots for a month for a crew position shall not be less than 3% of the total annual vacation time to be awarded for that crew position; provided, however, that there must be at least 1 slot available for bid in each crew position each month.</p>
<p>D. Splitting Vacations</p>
<p>A pilot may split his vacation into as many as 4 separate periods provided each period contains a minimum of 7 days vacation; provided further, however, that a pilot who has accrued fewer than 7 vacation days in the previous calendar year shall take all accrued vacation days as a single period. Once awarded, a period of vacation may not be split.</p>
<p>E. Change, Slide and Expansion of Vacation</p>
<p>1. Vacation Change</p>
<p>a. A pilot may exchange his vacation slot(s) for an open slot(s) in his crew position or trade his slot with another pilot in the same crew position; any other change in a pilot’s vacation slot requires the approval of flight management. A pilot who wishes to exchange or trade a vacation slot must accomplish the exchange/trade no later than 30 days prior to the beginning of the affected bid period.</p>
<p>b. Change of Crew Position</p>
<p>i. A pilot changing crew positions shall retain his previously awarded or assigned vacation period(s).</p>
<p>ii. If a pilot is unable to take his scheduled vacation due to a conflict with initial, transition or upgrade (ITU) training, and he is then activated with more than 120 days remaining until the end of the last bid period in the calendar year, then within 30 days following activation into his new crew position, he shall select a different vacation period(s). His selection shall be made from among the following slots in the current year:</p>
<p>(a) open slots; or</p>
<p>(b) slots currently held by any junior pilot in the new crew position; or</p>
<p>(c) slots retained by any junior pilot who is scheduled to activate in that same new crew position within 120 days following the pilot’s activation into his new crew position.</p>
<p>iii. Notwithstanding Section 7.E.1.b.ii., if fewer than 3 slots are available for selection when the pilot activates, Section 7.E.1.b.iv. shall apply.</p>
<p>iv. If a pilot is unable to take his scheduled vacation due to a conflict with ITU training, and he is activated with 120 days or less remaining until the end of the last bid period in the calendar year, he may select a different vacation period as provided in Section 7.E.1.b.ii. above. If no selection is made within 30 days following his activation, Section 7.E.1.b.v. below, shall apply.</p>
<p>v. If a pilot’s vacation is not rescheduled as provided in Section 7.E.1.b.ii., or E.1.b.iv., his vacation slot shall be bought back subject to the provisions of Section 7.G.6., or, as an exception to the 40% buy back, the pilot may request to have the credit hours of vacation affected by the training in Section 7.E.1.b.ii. paid. Any vacation not bought back shall be a positive adjustment to the pilot’s vacation bank for the following year. A vacation change or buy back required in connection with a crew position change shall not be considered a vacation cancellation.</p>
<p>vi. Selection of a junior pilot’s vacation slot shall not impact the junior pilot’s vacation award.</p>
<p>c. A pilot with vacation scheduled in a bid period in which he is in pay only bidding status as a result of sick leave may elect to take his vacation as scheduled or reschedule that vacation (as provided in Section 7.E.1.b.). For purposes of this paragraph, a pilot’s vacation credit hour bank shall be reduced by 6 CH for each day of vacation in his pay only bid period, and the remainder of his BLG/RLG shall be charged to his sick bank. An election to reschedule that vacation shall be made no later than the close of bidding for the bid period in which the vacation is scheduled.</p>
<p>2. Vacation Period Slide</p>
<p>a. A pilot may enter a vacation slide submission during the Conflict Input Window immediately before the bid period in which a trip(s) affected by the slide (or the vacation period itself, if no trip is affected) is scheduled to begin, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E2" target="_blank">Section 25.E.2.</a> (Conflict Input Window). A pilot may adjust his vacation period by sliding it up to a maximum of 5 days in either direction. However, the slide shall not reschedule any portion of that vacation into the preceding bid periods of November or December. A vacation period of more than 7 days, that begins in one bid period and ends in the following bid period, may be slid up to a maximum of 5 days in either direction.</p>
<p>Example: A vacation in the first week of January may not be slid back into December, but a vacation in the first week of February may be slid back into January. The slide must be accomplished during the Conflict Input Window for the January bid period (which is in late December).</p>
<p>b. A pilot may slide a vacation to conflict with a carryover trip as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7E2a" target="_blank">Section 7.E.2.a.</a>, only if he submits for the slide during the Conflict Input Window associated with the award of bid period in which the carryover trip began (e.g., the Conflict Input Window in the end of November (i.e., the Conflict Input Window for the December bid period award) is used to slide a January vacation to conflict with a December into January carryover trip).</p>
<p>c. If a pilot slides his vacation period to within 48 hours of the scheduled end of a trip in which the last activity is an international duty period, that trip shall be deemed in conflict with the vacation period, except for a trip described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D1ci" target="_blank">Section 12.D.1.c.i.</a></p>
<p>d. There is no maximum limit on the number of credit hours that may be touched by a vacation slide.</p>
<p>3. Vacation Expansion (Regular Line Holders)</p>
<p>a.   In addition to or in lieu of a vacation slide, a pilot awarded a regular line may expand his vacation period in either or both directions to conflict with a greater number of credit hours. However, a pilot may not expand his vacation from December into November, or from January into December. A pilot may submit for a vacation expansion during the Conflict Input Window immediately before the bid period in which a trip(s) affected by the expansion is scheduled to begin, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E2" target="_blank">Section 25.E.2.</a></p>
<p>b.   A vacation expansion shall not cause a vacation conflict that exceeds the credit hour value of the original vacation period by more than 6 CH. All days in the expanded vacation period shall be consecutive.</p>
<p>c.   A pilot may not expand his vacation period to conflict with a trip(s) that begins outside the bid period of his vacation as awarded or slid. However, a pilot awarded vacation that extends into the next bid period may expand within either bid period.</p>
<p>Example: A pilot awarded a 7 day vacation period in week 1 of August may slide his vacation back so that it overlaps both the August and July bid periods. He may then expand his vacation period to hit trips in either July or August in accordance with normal expansion rules.</p>
<p>d. A vacation period may not be expanded to cause a vacation conflict with a trip(s) that is scheduled to operate in whole or in part on the following days (i.e., base days): Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Years Eve or New Year’s Day.</p>
<p>F. Vacation Bank</p>
<p>Each pilot shall have a vacation credit hour bank established at the beginning of the bid period commencing closest to January 1, each year, based upon the vacation hours he has accrued (as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7B" target="_blank">Section 7.B.</a>). A pilot’s vacation credit hour bank shall be calculated by multiplying the number of vacation days by 6 CH. A pilot’s bank shall be adjusted for positive balances (as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7I3d" target="_blank">Section 7.I.3.d.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7E1bv" target="_blank">7.E.1.b.v.</a>, or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7G5c" target="_blank">7.G.5.c.</a>), or negative credit hour balances from the previous year’s vacation bank.</p>
<p>G. Vacation Bank Administration</p>
<p>1. Regular Line Holder</p>
<p>A regular line holder shall be removed from a trip(s) in conflict with his vacation period (as awarded or slid) or vacation expansion. Conflict with an international duty free buffer, as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D1d" target="_blank">Section 12.D.1.d.</a>, shall constitute a conflict with the trip protected by that buffer and may not be waived. The SCH value of the removed trip(s) shall be deducted from the pilot’s vacation credit hour bank.</p>
<p><em>Intent: A vacation period slides as a whole.</em></p>
<p>2. Secondary/Custom Line Holder</p>
<p>Except as otherwise specifically provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E4b" target="_blank">Section 25.E.4.b.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E5" target="_blank">E.5.</a>, for secondary line holders, the following shall apply to secondary and custom line holders:</p>
<p>a. A pilot shall receive a 48 hour duty free vacation buffer at each end of his vacation period provided that the buffer occurs in a bid period in which the pilot is awarded a secondary line. A vacation buffer shall not extend outside the bid period(s) in which the vacation occurred. A vacation buffer shall not create a conflict with a trip that began in the previous bid period.</p>
<p>b. A secondary line holder’s vacation credit hour bank shall be reduced by 6 CH for each day of vacation in the bid period not in conflict with a carryover trip or R-day, excluding the vacation buffer provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7G2a" target="_blank">Section 7.G.2.a.</a> above.</p>
<p>c. If a secondary line holder’s vacation period conflicts with a scheduled trip(s) or R-day(s), (e.g., carryover trip from the prior bid period, vacations spanning two bid periods) the pilot shall be removed from that trip(s) or R-day(s) and the following shall apply:</p>
<p>i. A conflict with an international duty free buffer (as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D1d" target="_blank">Section 12.D.1.d.</a>) shall constitute a conflict with the trip protected by that buffer.</p>
<p>ii. A pilot’s vacation credit hour bank shall be reduced by the SCH of any trip(s) removed and/or the R-day credit hour value for any R-day(s) removed.</p>
<p>iii. A pilot may waive the vacation buffer within the Conflict Input Window to avoid a conflict.</p>
<p>iv. A vacation buffer that touches a trip(s) or R-day is a conflict. A vacation buffer that touches an international buffer is not a conflict.</p>
<p>d. The following apply when a secondary line is awarded to a pilot with a scheduled vacation in the bid period.</p>
<p>i. A secondary line shall not be constructed with a trip(s) or R-day(s) in conflict with the vacation period or a vacation buffer.</p>
<p>ii. Days constituting a vacation buffer shall be constructed as scheduled days off on that secondary line.</p>
<p>iii. For purposes of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25D2" target="_blank">Section 25.D.2.</a> (secondary line construction), hours deducted from the pilot’s vacation credit hour bank for the bid period, other than carryover credit hours from the previous bid period, shall be considered as trip credit hours.</p>
<p>iv. For purposes of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7E1" target="_blank">Section 7.E.1.</a> (Vacation Change), hours deducted from the pilot’s vacation credit hour bank for the bid period, other than carryover credit hours from the previous bid period, shall be considered as trip credit hours constituting a trip guarantee.</p>
<p>v. For purposes of minimum days off protection, vacation days shall not be considered days scheduled free from duty; vacation buffer days shall be considered days scheduled free from duty. <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D1d" target="_blank">Section 12.D.1.d.</a> (international trip buffer) shall not apply when constructing a secondary line for a pilot with vacation in the bid period.</p>
<p>e. A secondary line holder may adjust his vacation period by sliding it up to a maximum of 5 days in either direction, except that the slide shall not reschedule any portion of that vacation into the preceding bid period. However, a vacation period that is scheduled for more than 7 days, that begins in one bid period and ends in the following bid period, may also be slid up to a maximum of 5 days in either direction. A vacation slide submission shall be entered during the Conflict Input Window for that vacation period.</p>
<p>f. The provisions of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7G2" target="_blank">Section 7.G.2.</a> shall apply to a pilot assigned a custom line (as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25I1a" target="_blank">Section 25.I.1.a.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25I1e" target="_blank">25.I.1.e.</a>).</p>
<p>3. Reserve Line Holder</p>
<p>a. A pilot shall receive a 48 hour duty free vacation buffer at each end of his vacation period provided that the buffer occurs in a bid period in which he is awarded a reserve line. A vacation buffer shall not extend outside the bid period(s) in which the vacation occurred. A vacation buffer shall not create a conflict with a trip that began in the previous bid period.</p>
<p>b. A reserve line holder’s vacation credit hour bank shall be reduced by the R-day value for each day of vacation in the bid period.</p>
<p>c. If a reserve line holder’s vacation period conflicts with a scheduled trip(s) or R-day(s) (e.g., carryover trip from the prior bid period, vacations spanning two bid periods), the pilot shall be removed from that trip(s) or R-day(s) and the following shall apply:</p>
<p>i. A conflict with an international duty free buffer (as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D1d" target="_blank">Section 12.D.1.d.</a>) shall constitute a conflict with the trip protected by that buffer, and may not be waived.</p>
<p>ii. A pilot’s vacation credit hour bank shall be reduced by the SCH of any trip(s) removed and/or the R-day credit hour value for any R-day(s) removed.</p>
<p>iii. A pilot may waive the vacation buffer during the Conflict Input Window to avoid a conflict with that buffer.</p>
<p>iv. A vacation buffer that touches a trip(s) or R-day is a conflict. A vacation buffer that touches an international buffer is not a conflict.</p>
<p>d. A reserve line awarded to a pilot with a scheduled vacation in the bid period shall be reconstructed as follows:</p>
<p>i. A pilot’s reconstructed line shall contain the originally scheduled blocks of R-days that did not conflict with vacation (or the vacation buffer), unless the number of R-days in those block(s) plus the number of vacation days exceeds the number of R-days in the bid period (i.e., the pilot’s vacation conflicts with fewer R-days than the number of vacation days). In that case, the line shall be reconstructed preserving the greatest number of originally scheduled R-day blocks as possible.</p>
<p>ii. A pilot may enter preferences for reconstruction of his reserve line during the Conflict Input Window (as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E2g" target="_blank">Section 25.E.2.g.</a>).</p>
<p>iii. A reserve line shall not be constructed with R-days in conflict with the vacation period or a vacation buffer.</p>
<p>iv. Days constituting a vacation buffer shall be scheduled days off on the reconstructed reserve line.</p>
<p>v. For purposes of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25D3" target="_blank">Section 25.D.3.</a> (Reserve Line construction), vacation days are considered R-days. <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25D3c" target="_blank">Section 25.D.3.c.</a> (mini-block R-days), shall not apply when reconstructing a reserve line for a pilot with vacation in the bid period.</p>
<p>vi. For purposes of determining RLG (as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4C" target="_blank">Section 4.C.</a>), vacation days are considered R-days. Credit hours deducted from the pilot’s vacation credit hour bank (as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7G3b" target="_blank">Section 7.G.3.b.</a>) shall be credited toward the pilot’s RLG.</p>
<p>vii. A reserve pilot’s leveling position shall include an R-day value for each day of vacation in the bid period, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4H2" target="_blank">Section 4.H.2.</a></p>
<p>viii. For purposes of minimum days off protection, vacation buffer days shall be considered days scheduled free from duty.</p>
<p>e. Reserve Vacation Extension</p>
<p>A pilot with vacation during a month in which he holds a reserve line may extend the vacation that occurs in that month. Vacation buffers shall then be added to the extended vacation as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7G3a" target="_blank">Section 7.G.3.a.</a>, unless waived by the pilot.</p>
<p>i. The maximum extension shall be determined by the following formula:</p>
<p>Maximum Extension = ({[(Number of vacation days (as awarded or slid) in the bid period multiplied by 6) + 6] ÷ R-day value} rounded down) minus the number of originally scheduled vacation days in the bid period.</p>
<p>Example: A pilot has a 7 day vacation period in a bid period in which the R-day value is 4:36. The maximum extension is</p>
<p>{[(7 x 6) +6] ÷ 4.600} - 7</p>
<p>= [(42 + 6) ÷ 4.600] - 7</p>
<p>= (10.434 rounded down) - 7</p>
<p>= 10 - 7 = 3.</p>
<p>Consequently, the pilot could add up to three days to his vacation period. This would give him a total of 14 days (presuming buffers could fit on both ends of his vacation period as extended). The pilot’s vacation bank would be charged 46 CH (10 x 4.600), but only 7 vacation days would be removed from his vacation accrual.</p>
<p>ii.    A pilot may enter a vacation extension submission during the Conflict Input Window immediately before the bid period in which the vacation is scheduled to occur.</p>
<p>iii.   A pilot may not extend his vacation (as awarded or slid) outside of the bid period.</p>
<p>iv.    In case of a vacation period scheduled to span 2 bid periods, if the pilot holds a reserve line in both bid periods, then for purposes of vacation extension, the vacation in each month shall be treated as if it were a separate vacation period.</p>
<p>Example: A pilot’s 10 day vacation period has 7 days in one bid period and 3 days in the next. The pilot holds a reserve line in both bid periods. R-day value in the first bid period is 4:36; in the second it is 4:47. The pilot may extend his vacation a maximum of 3 days in the first bid period (which must expand backward, since he can’t expand outside of the bid period). The vacation in the second month is treated as if it were a stand alone 3 day vacation period, for purposes of expansion. His maximum expansion would be 3 x 6 = 18 + 6 = 24 ÷ 4.783 = 5.017 rounded down = 5 minus 3 = 2 days of available extension.</p>
<p>v. A pilot may not extend his vacation period to conflict with a trip(s) that begins outside the bid period of his vacation as awarded or slid.</p>
<p>vi.    A vacation period shall not be extended to cause conflict with R-days scheduled on Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Years Eve or New Year’s Day.</p>
<p>4. If the SCH value of a pilot’s last vacation period in a year exceeds the balance in his vacation credit hour bank, he may elect to reduce the number of vacation days in his vacation period in order to avoid or reduce a deficit in his vacation bank. A pilot shall communicate this election to CRS during the Conflict Input Window.</p>
<p>5. Vacation Deficit and Make-Up</p>
<p>If a pilot’s vacation credit hour bank balance falls below the credit hour value of his remaining vacation in a calendar year, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>a.   The pilot may bid for a make-up vacation trip(s) during the View/Add window for the bid period in which the pilot has a vacation period that, if taken as scheduled, would result in a vacation bank deficit. The credit hour of the make-up vacation trip(s) shall not exceed the projected deficit by more than 6 hours.</p>
<p>b.   The pilot may submit for a make-up vacation trip(s) (as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25L6" target="_blank">Section 25.L.6.</a>) at any time during the calendar year.</p>
<p>c.   Make-up vacation credit hours earned in the last bid period of a calendar year (i.e., December) shall be credited to the pilot’s vacation credit hour bank for the following calendar year.</p>
<p>6. Clearing the Bank</p>
<p>a.   A pilot who has a positive balance in his vacation bank after his last vacation period of the year shall be paid for those credit hours, prior to the end of the year, at his pay rate at the beginning of the bid period in which the buy back is paid. The maximum balance subject to buy back is 40% of the vacation bank balance as of the beginning of the calendar year, including positive or negative adjustments from the previous year, plus positive adjustments in the current year, if any.</p>
<p>b.   Flight management may approve vacation buy back in excess of the 40% limit contained in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7G6a" target="_blank">Section 7.G.6.a.</a> above, due to a pilot’s extenuating circumstances.</p>
<p>H.   Disruption of Vacations</p>
<p>1. If a pilot’s trip operationally extends more than 2 hours but less than 26 hours into his vacation period, 6 CH shall be added to his vacation bank and 1 day shall be added to his next vacation period.</p>
<p>2. If a pilot’s trip operationally extends at least 26 hours but less than 48 hours into his vacation period, 18 CH shall be added to his vacation bank and 3 days shall be added to his next vacation period.</p>
<p>3. If a pilot’s trip operationally extends 48 hours or more into his vacation period, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>a.   The pilot may elect to cancel his vacation period and have an additional 24 hours credited to his vacation bank. The credit hours for the canceled vacation shall be restored to the pilot’s vacation bank, and he shall be eligible for substitution for the trip(s) from which he was removed for the vacation that was canceled; or,</p>
<p>b.   The pilot may elect to take the remainder of his vacation period, as scheduled, and have an additional 24 CH credited to his vacation bank.</p>
<p>I.   Cancellation of Vacation</p>
<p>1. A pilot’s vacation period may be canceled due to operational requirements.</p>
<p>2. If a pilot voluntarily cancels his vacation at Company request, he shall be paid, not<a id="_idTextAnchor244"></a> later than the <a id="_idTextAnchor245"></a>following bid period, the CH value of the canceled vacation, not to exceed the balance in his vacation credit hour bank, plus an additional 24 CH. The credit hour value of the canceled vacation shall be deducted from the pilot’s vacation bank.</p>
<p>3. If a pilot’s vacation is involuntarily canceled, the following shall apply.</p>
<p>a.   The pilot shall be notified of the cancellation in writing at least 30 days in advance.</p>
<p>b.   The pilot’s vacation bank shall be increased by 24 CH.</p>
<p>c.   The pilot may reschedule the canceled vacation period to a currently open vacation slot(s) or to a slot(s) held by any pilot junior to him in his crew position. The junior pilot’s vacation award shall not be impacted.</p>
<p>d.   If the pilot is unable to reschedule the canceled vacation period as provided in Section 7.I.3.c., the vacation hours shall be carried over into the following year.</p>
<p>e.   Notwithstanding <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7I3C" target="_blank">Section 7.I.3.c.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7I3d" target="_blank">d.</a>, the pilot may elect to be paid the credit hour value of his canceled vacation period, plus the additional 24 CH, in the manner provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7I2" target="_blank">Section 7.I.2.</a></p>

<p>(a)  The fly window shall begin 12 hours after the end of the pilot’s previous duty period. The fly window shall terminate 36 hours from its beginning point.</p>
<p>(b)  If there is a commercial flight with available seats within the fly window, the Company shall obtain such for the pilot (provided it complies with other provisions of the contract (e.g., minimum rest requirements)). The unavailability of the class of service otherwise required by Section 8 shall not be a reason justifying a failure to purchase a commercial ticket under this paragraph.</p>
<p>(c)  If there is a commercial flight(s) within the fly window but it has fewer available seats than the number of pilots requiring deadheads, the Company shall offer to purchase commercial ticket(s) in the following order: Captain, then First Officer. If there were multiple pilots holding the same crew position on the trip, the most senior pilot within that crew position will be given higher priority.</p>
<p>(d)  In the event that there are insufficient seats available on commercial flight(s) within the fly window, the Company may schedule a pilot for a Company jumpseat that departs at any time after the beginning of the fly window.</p>
<p>ii.    The fly window procedures shall not apply if:</p>
<p>(a)  The pilot would be placed at risk of substantial bodily harm, or loss of property or life due to his continued presence in a location during the fly window; or</p>
<p>(b)  There is any legal or regulatory reason why the pilot cannot deadhead on a commercial carrier (e.g., does not possess required visa); or</p>
<p>(c)  Application of the fly window procedures would result in the pilot being illegal for his next Company scheduled activity (e.g., flight duty, standby, reserve, training). In that case, if specifically authorized by the Duty Officer based on staffing needs (in case the pilot otherwise would miss non-training duty) or disruptions to training schedules (in cases where the pilot would miss training), the Company may schedule the pilot for any legal jumpseat that would protect his legality for further scheduled duty.</p>
<p>iii.   A pilot who is positioned by means of this provision (Deadhead by Company Aircraft to Base) shall be entitled to deviation bank credit in the amount of the Baseline Fare for a ticket in the highest class of service for which the pilot is eligible, on the first flight that would have been legal for the return deadhead, but for the unavailability of seats.</p>
<p>4. Administration of Deadhead Fares</p>
<p>a.   The Company shall publish the Baseline Fare for all scheduled commercial deadheads.</p>
<p>i.  For trips in the bid period package, the Baseline Fare is a fare quote obtained no earlier than 7 days before and no later than 2 days after the publication of the bid period package.</p>
<p>ii.    For trip revisions, and for trips constructed after the publication of the bid period package, which include a commercial deadhead(s) for which a Baseline Fare has not yet been published, the Baseline Fare is a fare quote obtained at the time the Company constructs or revises the trip.</p>
<p>iii.   A Baseline Fare is applicable to all crew positions on the trip containing the commercial deadhead.</p>
<p>b. The Company shall determine and publish the Established Fare for all scheduled commercial deadheads after the publishing of First Officer monthly bid awards as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25C11" target="_blank">Section 25.C.11.</a>, and no later than 14 days prior to the scheduled departure of the commercial deadhead (except where less than 14 days remain).</p>
<p>i. The Established Fare is a fare quote obtained pursuant to <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_8A4b" target="_blank">Section 8.A.4.b.</a></p>
<p>ii.    For trip revision(s) involving revision(s) to a deadhead(s), and for trips constructed after the publication of the bid period package, the Established Fare will be determined:</p>
<p>(a)  When a pilot is assigned to the trip, if 14 or more days remain prior to the scheduled departure of the deadhead;</p>
<p>(b)  14 days prior to the scheduled departure of the deadhead, if no pilot has been assigned as of that time; or</p>
<p>(c)  At the time the Company constructs or revises the trip, if less than 14 days remain prior to the scheduled departure of the deadhead.</p>
<p>iii.   An Established Fare is applicable to all crew positions on the trip containing the commercial deadhead.</p>
<p>c. The Baseline and Established Fare(s) for any trip containing a commercial deadhead shall also be included with the information associated with the trip in VIPS (e.g., displayed on the Trip Pairing screen).</p>
<p>5.    Class of Service for Commercial Deadhead Travel</p>
<p>Requirements regarding class of service shall apply when the trip is constructed with a deadhead. The Company shall not be in violation of this Section due to changes or conditions imposed by passenger carriers after the trip is constructed (e.g., increased or reduced block time, aircraft change, etc.). Regardless of whether such changes occur, a pilot’s deviation allowance is based on the class of service authorized in the original schedule.</p>
<p>a. Deadhead travel shall be booked in economy class unless a higher class of service is authorized.</p>
<p>b. A class of service higher than economy shall be authorized if:</p>
<p>i.  a deadhead exceeds 5 scheduled block hours;</p>
<p>ii.  a deadhead is included in a single duty period exceeding 11:30;</p>
<p>iii. the scheduled block hours of a revenue flight plus the scheduled block hours of a deadhead in a single duty period exceed 8 hours. However, if a domestic duty period does not exceed 11:30 and a deadhead within that duty period does not exceed 1:30 (OAG) block, the deadhead may be scheduled in economy;</p>
<p>iv.  the deadhead is an international deadhead that exceeds 2:30 scheduled block hours, and whose origin and destination are both outside the contiguous 48 United States; or</p>
<p>v.   as authorized by the SIG.</p>
<p>c. Higher Class of Service</p>
<p>i.   Regardless of a passenger carrier&amp;rsrsquo;s nomenclature or hierarchy for classes of service, a Flat Bed Seat satisfies the higher class of service requirements set forth in this Section.</p>
<p>ii.  If a higher class of service is authorized on a deadhead with less than 10 scheduled block hours, such service shall be booked in Business or First Class at the Company’s option, subject to availability on the scheduled flight. If a seat with the required class of service is not available when the Company books a seat for the pilot, the Company shall book a seat in the next highest class of service available, provided it places a request to upgrade to the required higher class(es) of service.</p>
<p>iii. If a deadhead has 10 or more scheduled block hours, the travel shall be booked in the following order based upon availability on the scheduled flight:</p>
<p>(a)    First Class (discounted);</p>
<p>(b)    Business Class (full fare or discounted);</p>
<p>(c)    First Class (full fare).</p>
<p>iv.  If the deadhead is scheduled for more than 16 hours duty, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>(a)    The flight must be a non-stop flight; and</p>
<p>(b)    A special booking priority shall apply to deadheads scheduled over 16 hours. That priority shall be:</p>
<p>(1)  Discounted first class;</p>
<p>(2)  Full fare first class;</p>
<p>(3)  Business class.</p>
<p>(c)    The Company shall ensure that Corporate Travel (or any subsequent Company designated travel administrator) attempts to secure first class seating at the earliest practical point in the planning process. If Corporate Travel is unable to book first class at the time the initial booking is made, Corporate Travel shall notify the pilot who is awarded that trip, via e-mail, of the unavailability of first class.</p>
<p>v.   If neither Business nor First Class is available on the scheduled flight, an economy class ticket (with a reservation to upgrade to the appropriate higher class) may be purchased only in the following two circumstances:</p>
<p>(a)    The scheduled deadhead flight is for the purposes of Operational Recovery; or</p>
<p>(b)    The scheduled deadhead duty period is 16 hours or less.</p>
<p>vi.  Regardless of the class of service actually ticketed, a pilot’s deviation bank shall be credited with the Baseline Fare for the highest class of service which is authorized on the scheduled deadhead flight, and which exists on that flight.</p>
<p>d. Company Purchase of Higher Class of Service Tickets in Bid Period Package</p>
<p>When purchasing deadhead tickets prior to the beginning of a bid period, deadhead tickets for flights entitled to a higher class of service shall be purchased prior to tickets requiring a lower class of service.</p>
<p>6. Deadhead Tickets</p>
<p>This paragraph shall apply equally to deviation deadhead tickets and Company scheduled deadhead tickets.</p>
<p>a.   A Company designated group or department shall be utilized for purchasing all deadhead tickets, except when:</p>
<p>i. the Company cannot purchase a ticket for a lower fare than the pilot can purchase himself; or</p>
<p>ii.    the pilot must purchase the ticket himself to prevent delay to FedEx flight operations.</p>
<p>b.   If a pilot does not purchase his deadhead ticket using the Company’s travel vendor, he shall use the Company issued Travel Card to purchase such ticket. In extenuating circumstances, a pilot may contact the Company to arrange a pre-paid ticket, or he may buy a deadhead ticket by other means, if necessary to prevent delay to FedEx flight operations (e.g., carrier won’t take the credit card, Travel Card unavailable).</p>
<p>c.   A pilot must either use his Company purchased deadhead ticket in conjunction with the trip for which it was scheduled or account for that ticket with the expense report reconciling his deviation expenses for the month. Upon written request, a pilot shall provide the Company proof of his use of a deadhead ticket.</p>
<p>B.   Deadhead by Surface Transportation</p>
<p>1. A pilot who is scheduled for surface transportation between two airports shall receive credit for pay toward the duty period calculation, for such deadhead, based on historical FedEx data as follows:</p>
<p>a.   :30 CH for each 1 hour, or portion thereof, up to a maximum of 2:30 CH.</p>
<p>b.   Surface transportation greater than 2 hours must be approved by the SIG.</p>
<p>2. The surface transportation shall be provided on a non-public commercial operator; provided, however, that between international locations specifically approved by the SIG (e.g., HKG-CAN and CGN-FRA), a pilot may be scheduled for ground transportation on a public commercial operator (e.g., train, hydrofoil).</p>
<p>3. Surface transportation between an airport and a layover facility is not deadhead by surface transportation, provided that the flights immediately preceding and following the layover operate from the same airport.</p>
<p>C.   Deviation From Scheduled Deadhead</p>
<p>The intent of the deviation policy is to allow a pilot business travel flexibility in accordance with the options and conditions specified herein. Except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_8C1fii" target="_blank">Section 8.C.1.f.ii.</a>, a pilot who deviates is responsible for his scheduled, revised, rerouted, or canceled trip. A deviating pilot must ensure his compliance with FAR crew rest requirements prior to operating a Company flight. A pilot who deviates from a scheduled deadhead shall earn trip guarantee as if he were deadheading as scheduled.</p>
<p>1. Deviating Operating Procedures</p>
<p>a.   Notification</p>
<p>i. A pilot shall notify the Company through VIPS of his intention to deviate from a scheduled deadhead at the beginning of a trip. This notification shall occur no later than 60 hours prior to the showtime of the scheduled deadhead.</p>
<p>ii.    Except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_8C1ai" target="_blank">Section 8.C.1.a.i.</a>, if a pilot is notified of a trip assignment less than 60 hours prior to showtime, upon notification, he shall advise the Company through VIPS of his deviation from a scheduled deadhead at the beginning of the trip.</p>
<p>iii.  If a pilot has provided notification of a deviation, and the deadhead at the beginning of a pilot’s trip is subsequently revised, upon notification he shall advise the Company through VIPS of his deviation on the revised deadhead.</p>
<p>iv.    Failure to notify the Company of a deviation as required may result in the deviation bank credit for the appropriate deadhead being deducted from the pilot’s deviation bank only if the cancellation of the scheduled deadhead results in a charge to the Company. Any such deduction shall not exceed the lesser of the value of the charge to the Company, or the deviation bank credit for that deadhead.</p>
<p>v.  A pilot may maintain 2 active reservations for each scheduled lane segment.</p>
<p>Example: A pilot may book his deviation travel itinerary before canceling his scheduled travel itinerary, except where a passenger carrier’s reservation systems will not allow the pilot to do so.</p>
<p>b. Trip Trade Restrictions After Deviation Notification</p>
<p>After a pilot provides notification of his deviation from a scheduled deadhead that originates or terminates in a location outside the contiguous 48 United States, Canada, or Mexico, the pilot may not trade, drop, or authorize a personal bump on the trip containing the deadhead if there are less than 14 days remaining until scheduled showtime of that trip, unless authorized by CRS or the Fleet Captain (or his designee).</p>
<p>c. Initial Deviation Check-In</p>
<p>A deviating pilot shall check in with VIPS, or CRS if VIPS is not accessible, no earlier than 60 hours and no later than 4 hours prior to showtime of the originally scheduled deadhead at the beginning of a trip. This check-in will satisfy the requirements of the final deviation check in if the pilot is already in position for the first revenue leg when he makes his Initial Deviation Check-In.</p>
<p>d.   Final Deviation Check-In</p>
<p>i. A deviating pilot shall check in with VIPS, or CRS if VIPS is not accessible, and indicate that he is positioned within 100 nautical miles, or at a distance as approved by his Fleet Captain (or his designee), of the airport from which the first revenue flight will depart or at which the pilot’s standby period begins. This check in must occur:</p>
<p>(a)  no later than 8 hours prior to showtime of a revenue flight that operates entirely within North America (i.e., Alaska, Canada, Mexico, the contiguous 48 United States, Caribbean and Puerto Rico);</p>
<p>(b)  no later than 12 hours prior to showtime of a revenue flight that either takes off from, or lands in, a city outside North America or a standby period that did not require an intercontinental deadhead from the pilot’s base; or</p>
<p>(c)  for a revenue flight or standby period that required an intercontinental deadhead from the pilot’s base, no later than:</p>
<p>(1)  18 hours prior to showtime of a revenue flight or commencement of the standby period; or</p>
<p>(2)  The scheduled arrival time of the Company scheduled deadhead at the location of the revenue flight or standby period (if less than 18 hours prior to the scheduled departure of the revenue flight or commencement of the standby period).</p>
<p>Example: A pilot deviates from his scheduled deadhead to CDG. The scheduled deadhead was scheduled to arrive in CDG 36 hours prior to showtime. The pilot’s final deviation check-in must occur no later than 18 hours prior to showtime.</p>
<p>Example: A pilot deviates from his scheduled deadhead to HKG. The scheduled deadhead was scheduled to arrive in HKG 17 hours prior to showtime. The pilot’s final deviation check-in must occur no later than 17 hours prior to showtime.</p>
<p>ii.    For purposes of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_8C1d" target="_blank">Section 8.C.1.d.</a> (this paragraph) the showtime of a revenue flight shall be one hour prior to the scheduled departure of that flight.</p>
<p>iii.   The final deviation check-in may occur at the same time as the initial deviation check-in if the pilot is already in position for the first revenue leg when he makes the initial deviation check-in.</p>
<p>iv.    Final deviation check-in may be accomplished if the deviating pilot joins the Company scheduled deadhead(s) and, as a result, he will arrive at the point of origin of the pilot’s first revenue flight or standby period as if the pilot had not deviated. Upon arrival at the departure gate of the scheduled deadhead flight, the pilot shall check-in with VIPS, or CRS if VIPS is not accessible, and indicate that he is in position for the scheduled deadhead flight. Once this check-in has been accomplished, the pilot shall no longer be considered as deviating, for the purposes of subsequent delays, revisions, and all trip services.</p>
<p>Example: The scheduled deadhead travel is MEM-ATL-CDG. The pilot deviates and obtains a ticket to join the scheduled ATL-CDG flight. Final deviation check-in may be accomplished upon arrival at the departure gate for the CDG flight in the ATL airport.</p>
<p>v.  If a final deviation check-in has not occurred as required, then prior to replacing the deviating pilot, CRS shall first place a call to the scheduled layover hotel, then a minimum of 2 calls based on the following hierarchy, unless the pilot has fewer than two phone numbers listed in VIPS:</p>
<p>(a)  VIPS primary contact number.</p>
<p>(b)  Cell phone number.</p>
<p>(c)  Alternate contact number #1.</p>
<p>(d)  Alternate contact number #2.</p>
<p>e.   Deviation Delay/Failure</p>
<p>If a pilot encounters difficulty in his deviation travel to the revenue departure location to such an extent that a live flight is jeopardized, he shall contact CRS at the earliest opportunity. If the notification to CRS is provided in sufficient time to allow the trip to be covered by a reserve, and the flight is not delayed due to the deviation failure, then the pilot will be dropped from the trip without pay, receive no deviation bank credit for the trip, and shall not be disciplined.</p>
<p>f.   Trip Revisions</p>
<p>i.  If a pilot’s trip is revised at or prior to his initial deviation check-in and, as a result, the pilot is unable to report on time, the trip shall be dropped and the pilot shall be eligible for Priority Non-Premium (PNP) make-up.</p>
<p>ii.    If a pilot’s trip is revised after his initial deviation check-in and, as a result, the pilot is unable to report on time, the Company shall make best efforts to reposition the pilot for the trip. If the Company is unable to do so, the pilot shall be eligible for substitution and is authorized return deadhead transportation to base. The cost of the original deadhead tickets shall be deducted from the pilot’s deviation bank, however, the cost of the deviation ticket used, and the cost of his return ticket, shall be allowable as a claim, up to the applicable fare (as determined in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_8C2a" target="_blank">Section 8.C.2.a.</a>) for the original deadhead tickets, regardless of the pilot’s deviation bank balance. Such claim shall be specifically documented on a deviation expense report.</p>
<p>iii.   A VLT/DRF/CMU pilot covered by <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_8C1fii" target="_blank">Section 8.C.1.f.ii.</a> shall not be eligible for substitution and shall earn the greater of 3:00 CH or duty rig computed from his scheduled showtime until the VIPS notification of the revision.</p>
<p>iv.    A deviating pilot is considered on a trip after the scheduled showtime of the pairing. Therefore, if a trip changes after showtime, the pairing will be rebuilt to reflect the changes.</p>
<p>g.   Mid-Trip Deviations</p>
<p>A pilot may deviate from a scheduled deadhead between any two revenue segments of a trip only with the prior approval of his Fleet Captain (or his designee).</p>
<p>h.   End-of-Trip Deviations</p>
<p>A pilot shall notify the Company through VIPS of his deviation from a deadhead scheduled at the end of a trip:</p>
<p>i.  at least 60 hours prior to the showtime for an international deadhead; or</p>
<p>ii.    at least 8 hours prior to the showtime for a domestic deadhead, unless the airline requires an earlier notification to avoid cancellation penalties, in which case the deviation notification must occur 12 hours prior to the carrier’s penalty deadline. The Company shall include the carrier’s cancellation policy in the E-Ticket issued to the pilot by the Company’s travel department or vendor.</p>
<p>i.   Business Status While Deviating</p>
<p>i. A pilot who deviates is considered to be on business travel (and shall be afforded all rights and benefits as such) while traveling under the provisions of this Section.</p>
<p>ii.    A pilot may book a Company jumpseat as all or part of his deviation travel. A pilot using a jumpseat for the purpose of a deviation shall have business jumpseat status (or equivalent booking status).</p>
<p>2. Deadhead Deviation Banks</p>
<p>a.   Application By Bid Period</p>
<p>The Company shall establish a deviation bank for each pilot for each bid period.</p>
<p>i. The value of a given bid period’s deviation bank shall be equal to the value of:</p>
<p>(a)  the applicable fare(s) for the scheduled commercial deadhead ticket(s) for all trips flown during that bid period; and</p>
<p>(b)  the value of the applicable fare(s) for the scheduled commercial deadhead ticket(s) for recurrent training scheduled during that bid period (if any).</p>
<p>ii.    To the extent that the pilot’s allowable/reimbursable deviation expense claims for a given bid period are less than his deviation bank credit for that bid period, that balance shall first be reduced by half. This deviation bank allowance (DBA) shall be available to offset past or future deviation bank overspends, as follows:</p>
<p>(a)  If the pilot had allowable/reimbursable deviation expense claims for the immediately preceding bid period which exceeded his deviation bank for that bid period, the DBA shall be applied to offset the prior overspend; and</p>
<p>(b)  Any DBA balance remaining after application of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_8C2aiia" target="_blank">Section 8.C.2.a.ii.(a)</a> above shall be added to the pilot’s deviation bank in the immediately subsequent bid period.</p>
<p>Example: For the April bid period, the pilot incurred allowable deviation expenses which exceeded his April deviation bank by $200. In May, the pilot incurred allowable deviation expenses which were $1,000 less than his deviation bank. The pilot’s DBA for May was $500, of which $200 rolled back to offset the pilot’s April overspend. The remaining $300 of the pilot’s May DBA shall be included in the pilot’s June deviation bank.</p>
<p>b.   Deviation Bank Credit</p>
<p>i.  Bid Period Package Deadhead</p>
<p>(a)  If the pilot notifies the Company of his deviation from a commercial deadhead prior to the first day of the bid period in which the applicable trip begins, the pilot’s deviation bank shall be credited with the higher of the Baseline Fare or the Established Fare.</p>
<p>(b)  If the pilot notifies the Company of his deviation from a commercial deadhead on or after the first day of the bid period in which the applicable trip begins, the pilot’s deviation bank shall be credited with the Established Fare.</p>
<p>ii.    Non-Bid Period Package Deadhead</p>
<p>For trip revision(s) involving revision(s) to a deadhead(s), and for trips constructed after the publication of the bid period package, the pilot’s deviation bank shall be credited with the higher of the Baseline Fare or the Established Fare.</p>
<p>c. A deadhead associated with a carryover trip shall be credited to the deviation bank for the bid period containing the showtime for the deadhead.</p>
<p>d.   All deadhead travel shall be classified into two categories, Front/Back-End, and Mid-Trip. For the purpose of deviation bank credit, each category shall be treated separately. However, if a deadhead trip is changed or canceled by the Company, the associated deadhead bank monies remain intact. Within each category, a pilot’s bank credit shall be determined as set forth in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_8C2a" target="_blank">Section 8.C.2.a.</a></p>
<p>e. With respect to a pilot who deviates on the front-end of a trip, but who does not actually operate any portion of the trip due to a sick call, the pilot shall be compensated and the pilot’s sick leave account shall be reduced by the scheduled credit hours for that entire trip, unless he has made a demonstrable effort to commence his deviation travel.</p>
<p>Example 1: A pilot deviates from his scheduled deadhead travel from MEM to CDG via ATL, and instead plans to travel from JAX to CDG via EWR. The pilot arrives at the JAX airport and calls in sick, after the scheduled showtime of the original trip. The pilot receives partial pay and credit for the trip up to the time of his sick call, with the balance of the trip guarantee charged to his sick bank, in accordance with Section 14.</p>
<p>Example 2: A pilot deviates from his scheduled deadhead travel from MEM to CDG via ATL, and instead plans to travel from DEN to CDG via ORD. The scheduled showtime for the MEM to ATL scheduled deadhead is 1540z on September 3. The pilot’s deviation deadhead from DEN to ORD has a showtime of 1100z on September 4. The pilot calls in sick from his home in DEN at 0900z on September 4. If the pilot holds trip guarantee, the pilot shall be compensated, and his sick leave account shall be reduced by the scheduled credit hours for the entire trip, in accordance with Section 14.</p>
<p>f.   A pilot in initial, transition or upgrade training (ITU) shall have a separate deviation bank established for the duration of such training. The training deviation bank shall be determined as set forth in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_8C2a" target="_blank">Section 8.C.2.a.</a></p>
<p>g.   Deviation expenses associated with ITU training shall be reconciled against the pilot’s training deviation bank by submission of an expense report at the end of his training period.</p>
<p>h.   Hotel Room Cancelation (HRC) Bank</p>
<p>i.  The Company shall establish a Hotel Room Cancelation (HRC) bank for each pilot.</p>
<p>ii.    For all hotel rooms canceled by a pilot through CRS or other designated means at least 26 hours prior to the scheduled hotel check-in (i.e., in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_5B7" target="_blank">Section 5.B.7.</a>), the Company shall credit $35 (domestic hotel reservations), or $65 (international hotel reservations) to that pilot’s HRC bank, provided, however, that the pilot actually operated the trip containing the canceled hotel room(s).</p>
<p>iii.   HRC bank credits shall be available to offset allowable/reimbursable deviation bank expenses incurred during any bid period.</p>
<p>iv.    The Company shall make available for his reference, via VIPS, a pilot’s current HRC bank balance.</p>
<p>v. A pilot’s HRC bank balance shall be capped at $10,000.</p>
<p>vi.    On-property sleep rooms are not guaranteed to pilots who cancel Company-scheduled hotel rooms (e.g., IND day rooms).</p>
<p>3. Deviation Options and Qualifying Expenses</p>
<p>Subject to the limitations and reporting provisions in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_8C4" target="_blank">Section 8.C.4.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_8C5" target="_blank">C.5.</a>, a pilot’s air travel, train travel, surface transportation, hotel use, parking and non-taxable per diem are allowable/reimbursable expenses as provided in this paragraph.</p>
<p>a.   Air Travel</p>
<p>i. In the following circumstances, air travel expenses are allowable/reimbursable:</p>
<p>(a)  to or from a pilot’s base to position to/from a scheduled assignment.</p>
<p>(b)  deviation from scheduled deadhead travel.</p>
<p>(c)  deviation from scheduled deadhead travel between a pilot’s base and training conducted away from his base.</p>
<p>ii.    Air travel expenses shall be limited to the applicable fare (as determined in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_8C2a" target="_blank">Section 8.C.2.a.</a>) for the class of service for which the deviation travel would otherwise qualify under <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_8A5" target="_blank">Section 8.A.5.</a></p>
<p>iii.  Seat selection fees (e.g., Southwest Business Select, Delta Economy Comfort, United Economy Plus), provided the pilot charges the fee(s) to his Company issued travel card (receipts required regardless of amount). Such fees shall be limited to the greater of:</p>
<p>(a)  $40 per flight segment; or</p>
<p>(b)  $80 per positioning sequence (i.e., front-end, mid-trip, or back-end).</p>
<p>iv.    Airport departure fees.</p>
<p>v. If a pilot scheduled for a nonstop deadhead over 16 hours on duty, who is not booked in first class, deviates from the scheduled deadhead in order to obtain first class on another carrier, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>(a)  the pilot shall include with his deviation expense report an e-mail from corporate travel indicating that first class was not available on the originally scheduled deadhead at the time the booking was made; and</p>
<p>(b)  the provision of the e-mail in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_8C3ava" target="_blank">Section 8.C.3.a.v.(a)</a> shall entitle the pilot to be reimbursed for his deviation ticket up to the full fare first class cost of a direct, nonstop deviation deadhead whose origin and destination match the scheduled deadhead, regardless of his deviation bank value. A deviation deadhead covered by this paragraph must be among the standard routings scheduled by the carrier.</p>
<p>vi.    If a pilot scheduled for a deadhead less than 16 hours on duty but more than 10 hours scheduled block hours, who is booked in economy class, deviates from the scheduled deadhead in order to obtain a higher class of service on another carrier, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>(a)  the pilot’s Deviation Bank shall be credited with 130% of the Established Fare on the scheduled deadhead routing; and</p>
<p>(b)  the pilot’s deviation travel is not required to match the scheduled deadhead routing.</p>
<p>b.   Surface Transportation</p>
<p>i. Surface (including water borne) transportation expenses between a field airport/FedEx operations area and the layover hotel are allowable/reimbursable.</p>
<p>(a)  The vendor for surface transportation shall be selected in the following order:</p>
<p>(1)    Company provided transportation (crew bus), or hotel transportation; or, if unavailable,</p>
<p>(2)    The contract vendor in that city; or, if unavailable,</p>
<p>(3)   Another vendor, in which case reimbursement for surface transportation is limited to $150 per occurrence, unless a higher charge is authorized by the pilot’s Fleet Captain, or his designee.</p>
<p>(b)  Surface transportation used at other than the scheduled pickup time shall not be direct billed.</p>
<p>ii.    Surface (including water borne) transportation of reasonable expense between commercial locations, or between a residence and the field airport/FedEx field operations area, greater than $100 per occurrence requires prior approval by a pilot’s Fleet Captain. Approval requests shall be available via the Company’s online expense reporting system.</p>
<p>iii.   A pilot who is assigned to initial, transition or upgrade training away from his base may elect to drive his vehicle to the training location. In this event, the AAA calculated mileage, round trip from the pilot’s permanent residence to the training facility at the current IRS mileage rate shall be allowable/reimbursable (e.g., training in DFW and a pilot drives his car to and from).</p>
<p>c.   Trains</p>
<p>Travel by train or subway is an allowable/reimbursable expense to the same extent air travel or surface transportation expenses would have been allowable/reimbursable.</p>
<p>d.   Hotel</p>
<p>i.  Non-Intercontinental Deadheads</p>
<p>A pilot who is scheduled for consecutive non-intercontinental deadheads from and back to the same city, may expense up to 3 nights of hotel use in the contract hotel in lieu of the scheduled deadhead tickets. The hotel use shall be between the scheduled deadheads. Use of a non-contract hotel, and any hotel use for greater than 3 nights, requires prior approval of the pilot’s Fleet Captain, or his designee.</p>
<p>ii.    Intercontinental Deadheads</p>
<p>(a)  A pilot who deviates from intercontinental deadhead travel may expense up to 3 nights of hotel use in lieu of the scheduled deadhead ticket. The hotel use shall be on consecutive days in conjunction with the revenue portion at the beginning or end of a trip. Hotel use for greater than 3 nights requires prior approval of the pilot’s Fleet Captain, or his designee.</p>
<p>(b)  A pilot who deviates from intercontinental deadhead travel may expense hotel(s) as part of his deviation travel as follows:</p>
<p>(1)    he may expense 1 hotel room as a deviation expense; or</p>
<p>(2)    he may expense up to the same number of hotel rooms as in his scheduled deadhead.</p>
<p>iii.  A pilot who deviates from deadhead travel at the beginning of a trip may check in at the contract hotel a maximum of 2 days early. This hotel use is a deviation expense charged to his bid period deviation bank.</p>
<p>iv.    When hotel use is an allowable/reimbursable deviation expense:</p>
<p>(a)  the pilot is responsible for his hotel reservation;</p>
<p>(b)  reimbursement shall be limited to the contract hotel rate for the city associated with the revenue portion of the trip; and</p>
<p>(c)  authorized expenses shall not be direct billed.</p>
<p>e.   Non-Taxable Per Diem</p>
<p>A pilot claiming hotel use as a deviation expense under <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_8C3di" target="_blank">Section 8.C.3.d.i.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_8C3dii" target="_blank">ii.</a> may also claim non-taxable per diem for the period covered by his hotel reimbursement claim (i.e., one night hotel use equals 24 hours per diem) and not otherwise covered by per diem for a scheduled trip. This per diem shall be paid at the rate for the city associated with the revenue portion of the trip.</p>
<p>f. Parking</p>
<p>A pilot may claim up to $375 per quarter for parking passes or fees at an airport outside his base.</p>
<p>4. Limitations on Deviation Expenses</p>
<p>The following limitations apply to deviation expenses:</p>
<p>a. All deviation expenses shall be paid for using the Company issued Travel Card, unless:</p>
<p>i.   the vendor will not accept the card; or</p>
<p>ii.  the vendor has rendered both authorized and unauthorized deviation expenses, and refuses to allow the pilot to pay for authorized expenses with the Company Card and for unauthorized expenses in another manner. In this case, the pilot shall pay the vendor’s bill by personal means, and shall submit an expense report requesting reimbursement for the authorized expenses.</p>
<p>b. Expenses which are otherwise allowable/reimbursable, but which exceed the value of a pilot’s deviation bank are the pilot’s responsibility, and shall be handled in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_8C5b" target="_blank">Section 8.C.5.b.</a></p>
<p>c.   The Company shall pay all fees associated with scheduled deadhead tickets. Fees associated with an unused deviation ticket shall not be allowable unless a Company schedule change was the reason why the ticket could not be used, or had to be changed. These costs/fees shall be handled in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_8C5b" target="_blank">Section 8.C.5.b.</a>, and shall be limited to the actual cost but shall not exceed $25 per transaction.</p>
<p>Note: When a deviating pilot arranges for the booking of his deviation travel, either via an electronic system(s) or by phone contact with the Company’s travel department or vendor, the Company is responsible for any of the above-listed fees that may be incurred due to the cancellation of the scheduled travel, and/or the booking of the pilot’s deviation travel itinerary. However, in the event the pilot makes any subsequent changes to his deviation travel itinerary, and if those changes result in any of the above-listed fees, he shall be responsible for those fees.</p>
<p>d. All deviation travel must be on a commercial carrier, except as specifically authorized otherwise in this Section.</p>
<p>e. Travel claimed as a deviation expense must begin or end within 3 days of the scheduled assignment to/from which the pilot is deviating (e.g., scheduled deadhead, trip or R-day) and must proceed to the intended destination of the deviation with no greater than a 24 hour delay enroute, domestically, and a 48 hour delay en route internationally.</p>
<p>f. When a pilot claims hotel use in lieu of a scheduled deadhead ticket(s) as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_8C3di" target="_blank">Section 8.C.3.d.i.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_8C3dii" target="_blank">ii.</a>:</p>
<p>i.   the scheduled deadhead ticket(s) establishes a “mini-bank” (i.e., claims based on that ticket(s) are allowable/reimbursable only up to the cost of that scheduled deadhead ticket(s)); and</p>
<p>ii.  the value of the deadhead ticket(s) may not be used for any deviation expense other than hotel use (as provided in Section 8.C.3.d.i. or ii.) and non-taxable per diem.</p>
<p>g. Expenses, other than those identified in this section as authorized, are not allowable/reimbursable (e.g., expenses associated with the use of a personal vehicle (other than allowable parking expenses), telephone, food, newspapers, recreation, etc., are not allowable/reimbursable).</p>
<p>5. Reporting Procedures</p>
<p>a.   Any time an expense is charged to a Company-issued Travel Card, a deviation ticket is purchased, or a deviation expense is incurred, an expense form shall be submitted, with appropriate original receipts (or electronic reproduction thereof). Boarding passes are required for tickets purchased with personal funds. Receipts are not required for reimbursable expenses under $25. Such expense form shall be submitted no later than the end of the subsequent bid period.</p>
<p>b. If a pilot’s allowable deviation expenses for a bid period exceed the value of his deviation bank (as adjusted by operation of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_8C2aii" target="_blank">Section 8.C.2.a.ii.</a>, if applicable) for such bid period or if a pilot has incurred unallowable expenses, the Company shall utilize payroll deduction to satisfy the pilot’s balance, subject to the 25% limit expressed in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_3E" target="_blank">Section 3.E.</a></p>
<p>c.   A pilot shall designate on his online expense report any claim for deviation travel expenses incurred while commuting to or from his base. The amount of such claim that is allowed/reimbursed shall be included in the pilot’s income as taxable compensation and all applicable taxes will be withheld.</p>

<p>7. The Company will provide a means, via VIPS or successor automation, for each pilot to indicate his willingness to operate humanitarian or publicity flights (PDH assignments) for per diem only, and without any other compensation of any kind. To the extent that PDH assignments are made, those assignments will be made subject to the following, and in lieu of the normal assignments orders prescribed by <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25G" target="_blank">Section 25.G.</a>:</p>

<p>C. Except for pilots assigned to the flight test group, line pilots shall not be required to conduct engine-out ferry, test or experimental flights.</p>
<p>D.   Except for line pilots assigned to the flight test group who may be required to hold and maintain multiple ratings and qualifications, no line pilot covered by this Agreement shall be required by the Company to maintain currency in more than 1 type rating. This paragraph shall not be construed to prohibit the Company from requiring pilots to maintain qualifications in aircraft with a common type rating.</p>
<p>E.   Flight Project Specialist (FPS) and Technical Advisor/Aircraft (TAA)</p>
<p>1. The duties and conditions of a FPS/TAA shall be at the discretion of his manager. Such conditions may include but shall not be limited to dual aircraft and/or seat qualifications, and any attendant special training and certification required. However, those duties and conditions may not contradict provisions of this Agreement.</p>
<p>2. FPS/TAA shall bid for and be awarded a bid line for flying purposes or pay only, as determined by his manager, in his primary crew position. For purposes of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_9E" target="_blank">Section 9.E.</a> an FPS’s “primary crew position” means the crew position in which the pilot is currently performing his line flying activities (i.e., seniority bid position). Unless released to the line for an entire bid period by his manager, a FPS/TAA shall bid pay only, and shall be awarded a BLG/RLG and compensated as follows:</p>
<p>a.   In addition to all other compensation to which he is entitled, an FPS/TAA shall receive a bid period override commencing with the first month in the program. An FPS/TAA on extended sick leave, incapable of performing duties as assigned, shall have his FPS/TAA override suspended effective 90 days from the first day of the bid period following his sick election in VIPS. His Bid Period Override will be resumed when the pilot is off sick status.</p>
<p>The bid period override shall be as follows:</p>
<p>Year 1 = $1,500</p>
<p>Year 2 = $1,600</p>
<p>Year 3 = $1,700</p>
<p>Year 4 and above = $1,900</p>
<p>b.   An FPS shall receive an additional $300 per bid period if he is required to maintain qualification in more than one aircraft.</p>
<p>c.   An FPS/TAA who performs FPS/TAA duties on a day(s) off in excess of the duty requirements contained in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_9E5b" target="_blank">Section 9.E.5.b.</a> shall be compensated as follows:</p>
<p>i. For work involving flight deck duties, a pairing shall be constructed and the pilot shall earn trip guarantee at 150% of his normal pay rate, when he blocks out on such pairing; and</p>
<p>ii.    For each additional work day not involving flight deck duties he shall earn R-day value.</p>
<p>iii.   Failure to block out will result in showpay.</p>
<p>3. An FPS/TAA who elects to resign his position must notify his manager at least 3 bid periods in advance.</p>
<p>a.   The notification period may be reduced at the discretion of his manager.</p>
<p>b.   The FPS/TAA may be retained in the program for up to 3 months beyond his desired resignation date at the discretion of his manager, or 6 months by mutual consent.</p>
<p>c.   The FPS/TAA is eligible to participate, without restriction, in any System Bid which closes subsequent to the effective date of his resignation.</p>
<p>d.   The crew position of an FPS/TAA who resigns, or is released from his FPS/TAA status absent an open System Bid or FTPA crew position, shall be determined by comparing his system-wide seniority against the results of the most recent System Bid. If the pilot is awarded or assigned a different crew position than his current crew position, his training, or base transfer activation, shall be determined in the same manner as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_13A6e" target="_blank">Section 13.A.6.e.</a></p>
<p>4. An FPS/TAA pilot holds his FPS/TAA position at the discretion of his manager.</p>
<p>5. During each bid period, the Company shall construct a work day schedule for each FPS/TAA as follows:</p>
<p>a.   An FPS/TAA may designate days free from duty as follows:</p>
<p>i. Up to 5 days off, which may not be in more than 2 blocks, in a 4-week bid period;</p>
<p>ii.    Up to 7 days off, which may not be in more than 2 blocks, in a 5-week bid period; or</p>
<p>iii.   Up to 8 days off, which may not be in more than 2 blocks, in a 6-week bid period.</p>
<p>He may provide primary and secondary requests regarding which specific days shall be his inviolate days off, and the Company shall accommodate those requests in seniority order. The Company shall make all reasonable efforts to award a pilot’s requested days off by seniority.</p>
<p>b.   The maximum number of duty days on an FPS/TAA’s bid period schedule shall not exceed the maximum number of R-days in the bid period. In addition, an FPS/TAA may have up to 5 days of carryover, if bid. Carryover days will be paid only if work is available, as determined by the manager.</p>
<p>c.   If an FPS/TAA is working consecutive months in pay only status, he may work the carry over portion in either month, provided enough work is available, as determined by his manager.</p>
<p>d.   An FPS/TAA, bidding in a pay only status, shall be notified of his bid period schedule by 1700 LBT on the Friday prior to the beginning of the bid period.</p>
<p>e.   Additional work days may not be scheduled without an FPS/TAA’s consent. If the FPS/TAA performs assigned duties on a day previously scheduled free from duty, he shall be entitled to compensation as per <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_9E2c" target="_blank">Section 9.E.2.c.</a>, as applicable.</p>
<p>f.   An FPS/TAA may operate open time assignments (e.g., M/U, VLT or DRF) in his primary crew position provided such assignments do not conflict with his scheduled work days. An FPS/TAA operating as a line pilot shall only operate revenue trips in his primary crew position.</p>
<p>g.   When an FPS/TAA is positioning to or from a location other than his assigned base, the class of service for his deadhead will be as provided in Section 8.</p>
<p>h.   Bid periods in which an FPS/TAA is scheduled for an awarded vacation shall be line flying bid periods to the extent practical. An FPS/TAA, however, who performs FPS/TAA duties during a month in which he has vacation shall have his bid period schedule reduced, day for day, by the number of days in his vacation period. His vacation bank shall be reduced by an R-day value for each day of vacation. An FPS/TAA:</p>
<p>i. May adjust his vacation period by sliding it up to a maximum of 5 days in either direction, in accordance with Section 7.</p>
<p>ii.    Shall receive, if requested, a 48 hour duty free vacation buffer at each end of his vacation period. A vacation buffer shall not extend outside the bid period(s) in which the vacation occurred. A vacation buffer shall not create a conflict with a trip that began in the previous bid period.</p>
<p>i.   An FPS/TAA on sick leave shall have his sick bank reduced by R-day value for each work day missed due to sick.</p>
<p>6. An FPS/TAA pilot is eligible to participate in System Bids that close during his tenure as an FPS/TAA pilot, but will not receive an actual award without a release from his manager. Flight Project Specialist and Technical Advisor/Aircraft Pay Adjustment (FTPA) shall be administered in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11Q" target="_blank">Section 11.Q.</a> (Check Airman/Instructor Pilot Pay Adjustment (CIPPA)), as if the FPS/TAA were a Check Airman or Instructor Pilot.</p>
<p>7. Non-FPS/TAA Pilot Performing FPS Duties</p>
<p>With his concurrence, a qualified pilot who is not an FPS may be assigned FPS duties.</p>
<p>a.   If his FPS duties conflict with a trip(s), the pilot shall be removed from that trip(s) and shall earn trip guarantee. If the number of trip days removed exceeds the number of days on which the pilot performed FPS duties, he may be scheduled for additional FPS duties to make up the excess days.</p>
<p>b.   If a pilot performs FPS duties on a day off, he shall be compensated as follows:</p>
<p>i. For work involving flight deck duties, a pairing shall be constructed and the pilot shall earn trip guarantee at 150% of his normal pay rate, when he blocks out on such pairing; and</p>
<p>ii.    For each additional work day not involving flight deck duties he shall earn R-day value.</p>
<p>iii.   Failure to block out will result in showpay.</p>
<p>c.   A pilot shall receive an additional $300 per bid period for each bid period in which he performs FPS flight deck duties.</p>
<p>F.   Quality Assurance (QA) Program</p>
<p>To the extent that the Company continues to operate a Quality Assurance (QA) Program, the following shall apply to any pilots designated as QA Observers:</p>
<p>1. QA Observers</p>
<p>a.   QA Observers shall not be Management pilots, Check Airmen, or Instructor Pilots.</p>
<p>b.   QA Observers shall be designated as TAAs.</p>
<p>c.   A QA Observer shall be designated as an Additional Crew Member (ACM) (for priority purposes only) on the FP/R for any flight on which he is assigned by the Company to perform duties associated with the QA Program. This designation shall not be construed as eroding the authority of a Pilot-in-Command (PIC) under relevant FAA regulations and interpretive guidance and/or under relevant provisions of the Company’s Flight Operations Manual concerning access to the cockpit.</p>
<p>2. QA Observations</p>
<p>a.   Line checks, operating experience, or other training flights shall not be used to conduct a QA Observation.</p>
<p>b.   Observation of cockpit activities shall be conducted on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p>i. Before conducting a QA Observation, the QA Observer will first ask the PIC for permission to conduct a QA Observation.</p>
<p>ii.    If the PIC decides not to participate in the QA Observation, the QA Observer will not conduct an observation during the flight.</p>
<p>iii.   The QA Observer may occupy a cockpit jumpseat, subject to the PIC’s authority concerning access to the cockpit.</p>
<p>iv.    If a cabin (i.e., non-cockpit) jumpseat is available, the QA Observer may occupy that cabin jumpseat on the flight.</p>
<p>c.   Identified information related to a QA Observation, including any data, a pilot’s statements, performance, and actions observed (including a PIC’s decision to not participate in the QA Observation) shall not be used in any Section 19 or related Section 21 proceeding.</p>
<p>d.   Identified information related to a QA Observation including any data, a pilot’s statements, performance, and actions observed (including a PIC’s decision to not participate in the QA Observation) shall not constitute grounds for placement in any Section 11 process, any Enhanced Oversight Program, or any other similar program and/or training.</p>
<p>3. The QA Program shall ensure the confidentiality and anonymity of individual crewmembers. Under no circumstances should it be possible to connect or otherwise identify individuals or a crew that operated a flight on which a QA Observation was conducted.</p>

<p>1. A pilot shall not have completed CBT/LMS until he scores 100%.</p>
<p>2. The required minimum score on any written or electronic exam is 70%, unless a higher score is required by the FARs or AQP source documents.</p>
<p>3. Validation/evaluation events will be recorded as overall satisfactory (S), unsatisfactory (U), or marked as incomplete (I).</p>
<p>4. If a first validation/evaluation event in any phase is unsuccessful, an instructor’s recommendation is required for the second validation/evaluation event in that phase.</p>
<p>H.   The Training Review Board (TRB)</p>
<p>1. General Decision-Making</p>
<p>The TRB is established to resolve situations involving individual pilots in training.</p>
<p>The TRB shall be governed by a train to proficiency philosophy for pilots in training. Individual pilots will be dealt with on a case by case basis, without regard to past precedent. If reasonable progress is being made and there is reason to believe the pilot will ultimately be successful, training is usually extended. The overall goal of the TRB is the continuing improvement and quality assurance of the Company’s training program. The TRB shall make its decisions and recommendations based on consensus (i.e., Consensus of the Training Review Board).</p>
<p>2. The TRB shall be notified following the failure of any validation/evaluation event or failure to achieve any required recommendations. The appropriate training manager administers remedial training in accordance with TRB prescriptions.</p>
<p>3. The TRB shall meet to consider any of the following situations (for which there are no remedial training prescriptions):</p>
<p>a. The election of a pilot to withdraw from training on or after the first day of training;</p>
<p>b.   A failure of TRB assigned additional training;</p>
<p>c.   A failure to be recommended for a validation/evaluation event;</p>
<p>d.   A second failure of an evaluation event;</p>
<p>e.   A failure to complete recurrent downbid training (<a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11J6" target="_blank">Section 11.J.6.</a>);</p>
<p>f.   At the discretion of the TRB, a failure of an evaluation event while enrolled in the Enhanced Oversight Program (EOP);</p>
<p>g.   If a pilot is initially covered under the ASAP program, but is ultimately excluded from the program as provided in ASAP MOU paragraph 11.f., his case shall be referred to the TRB for any necessary requalification training (as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_26Y4" target="_blank">Section 26.Y.4.</a>); or</p>
<p>h.   Training irregularities (e.g., ITU, recurrent) that occur during a pilot’s probationary period, provided however, that the TRB’s involvement does not limit the Company’s rights to apply <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_22B1f" target="_blank">Section 22.B.1.f.</a></p>
<p>4. Except in extenuating circumstances, the TRB shall confer within 2 business days following the occurrence of an event that requires a TRB meeting.</p>
<p>a.   The TRB shall conduct activities in strict confidence. TRB meetings shall be restricted to TRB members unless all TRB members agree otherwise, on a case by case basis. If a non-TRB member(s) is permitted at a TRB meeting, such attendee(s) shall be bound by the same confidentiality requirements that are applicable to the TRB members.</p>
<p>b.   The Company shall provide the TRB members and the pilot with copies of the pilot’s training records and any other documents pertaining to the matter no later than 2 business days prior to the TRB meeting.</p>
<p>c.   The pilot shall have the right to make a presentation and to offer input to the TRB. The pilot may be required to appear before the TRB. Any time a pilot appears before the TRB, at the pilot’s request, an Association representative may observe the proceedings during the time of the pilot’s presence.</p>
<p>d.   When necessary, Association TRB members shall be removed from activities to attend TRB meetings as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_18A2a" target="_blank">Section 18.A.2.a.</a></p>
<p>5. The TRB shall have broad discretion in the action to be taken by individual pilots and the Company. TRB meetings shall occur in the manner agreed upon by TRB members (e.g., in person, telephonically, electronically, etc.). Action may include, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>a.   Additional training;</p>
<p>b.   Change of instructor;</p>
<p>c.   Change of support pilot;</p>
<p>d.   Change of training times;</p>
<p>e.   Change of training location;</p>
<p>f.   Removal of pilot from ITU/recurrent training;</p>
<p>g.   Crew position freezes;</p>
<p>h.   Crew position reassignment consistent with the pilot’s seniority, based upon the same or a subsequent System Bid;</p>
<p>i.   Individual plans for requalification training, which may include crew position assignment, duration of freeze, and/or training plan;</p>
<p>j.   Referral to MEC Pilot Assistance Committee;</p>
<p>k.   Referral to System Chief Pilot, who shall address his case as circumstances warrant;</p>
<p>l.   Pilot counseling;</p>
<p>m.   Enrollment in the EOP;</p>
<p>n.   Other.</p>
<p>6. In the absence of a consensus concerning TRB recommended actions, the SCP shall use his best efforts to broker a consensus among the members of the TRB. In the event consensus cannot then be reached, the SCP shall determine the resolution. In the event the SCP is not on the Master Seniority List, the Company shall designate a member who is on the Master Seniority List to perform these functions.</p>
<p>7. If a pilot disagrees with the TRB’s decision, the pilot may appeal such to the SCP.</p>
<p>8. If the TRB authorizes additional training and if, after additional training, the pilot is still unable to progress further in the training program or unable to pass the required tests or validations/evaluations, the pilot’s matter will be referred back to the TRB for disposition. When a case has been referred back to the TRB after an earlier decision has not produced the desired results, the TRB may direct additional actions, (including referral to the SCP).</p>
<p>9. The deliberations and decisions of the TRB shall be non-precedential and shall not be discoverable, referenced or introduced as evidence in any grievance proceeding or arbitration involving any pilot other than the pilot to whom the TRB deliberations and decisions pertain.</p>
<p>10.    Pilots frozen in their crew position or in any way restricted from freely exercising their seniority rights shall not be eligible for System Bid awards for the duration of such freeze. Upon written request from the pilot, the SCP shall review crew position freezes approximately at the midpoint of the freeze for reconsideration.</p>
<p>I.   Enhanced Oversight Program (EOP)</p>
<p>1. The EOP exists to ensure that pilots who have demonstrated notable deficiencies during training or evaluation events maintain the required Company standards after remediation has been completed.</p>
<p>2. Pilots will normally be enrolled into the EOP following a validation/evaluation grade of unsatisfactory. The Training Review Board (TRB) may also enroll a pilot in the EOP.</p>
<p>3. The period of the EOP enrollment will normally extend 12 months from the date successful remediation is complete. However, should a subsequent evaluation/validation failure occur during the pilot’s enrollment period, his enrollment may be extended to a date beyond the initial 12 months as determined by the TRB.</p>
<p>4. Pilots entering the EOP will be advised via VIPS notification of their enrollment. Assuming no deficiencies are noted during a pilot’s EOP enrollment, the pilot will be released from the EOP and advised via VIPS notification.</p>
<p>5. The 4 principal members of the TRB will comprise the Enhanced Oversight Group (EOG), and will have direct access to, and will jointly manage the EOP list. The EOG will confer on a quarterly basis to review the EOP list and to ensure its accuracy.</p>
<p>J.   Withdrawals, Removals, Freezes and Reassignments</p>
<p>1. A pilot may elect to withdraw from training at any time.</p>
<p>2. If the pilot elects to withdraw from training prior to his award or assignment to a monthly training slot, the election will be reviewed by the System Chief Pilot (SCP).<a id="_idTextAnchor271"></a></p>
<p>a.   If extenuating circumstances exist, the pilot will return to his current crew position and shall incur no crew position freeze.</p>
<p>b.   If extenuating circumstances do not exist, the pilot will return to his current crew position, and may incur a crew position freeze of no longer than 3 years from the date of the election of the withdrawal.</p>
<p>3. If the pilot elects to withdraw from training after his award or assignment to a monthly training slot, the election will be referred to the TRB, who will meet and review it. Provided that the TRB agrees with the election, the TRB shall make decisions regarding requalification but shall also refer the case to the SCP for possible imposition of a crew position freeze (of no longer than 3 years from the date of the withdrawal election).</p>
<p>4. If, due to a withdrawal or removal from training, a pilot would otherwise return to his current crew position but is unable to do so because the position is unavailable for one of the following reasons, his situation shall be addressed as provided in Section 11.J.5. below. A pilot’s current crew position is unavailable if:</p>
<p>a. between the closing date of the bid on which he was awarded the position for which he is training and the date on which he would otherwise return to his current crew position, a more senior pilot has been assigned from the current crew position of the pilot in training; or</p>
<p>b. his current crew position no longer exists (e.g., his base has closed); or</p>
<p>c. he is ineligible to hold that position due to a legal restriction (e.g., regulated age, medical restriction).</p>
<p>5. If a pilot is unable to return to his current crew position because that position is unavailable as provided in Section 11.J.4., the following shall apply:</p>
<p>a. he shall be awarded a crew position in the same crew status as his most recent crew position, provided he has sufficient seniority to hold that position; or</p>
<p>b. if he is unable to designate a crew position in accordance with Section 11.J.5.a., he shall be awarded a crew position he chooses, consistent with his seniority; or</p>
<p>c. if his seniority does not enable him to hold a crew position under Section 11.J.5.a. or b., his employment status shall be determined by the Vice President, Flight Operations, consistent with the seniority and qualifications of the affected pilot.</p>
<p>6. After the second consecutive failure of a recurrent validation/evaluation event(s), a Captain may elect to downbid to the F/O crew seat in the aircraft and base in which he was qualified as Captain. If he completes that training he shall be frozen for 2 years in that crew position, and shall not be eligible for System Bid awards for the duration of such freeze. If he does not complete that training, his case shall be addressed by the TRB.</p>
<p>K. Continuing Qualification Training</p>
<p>1. Ground Training</p>
<p>A pilot shall be required to satisfactorily complete the following recurrent training activities as required by airplane specific AQP source documents and the FARs:</p>
<p>a. A pilot qualified in an aircraft type may require classroom ground school training.</p>
<p>b. A distance learning program may be used in lieu of classroom training. Completion of any Company required home study entitles the pilot to pay in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4I4d" target="_blank">Section 4.I.4.d.</a> He shall complete recurrent distance learning by the 23rd day of his grace month or 48 hours prior to the start of any activities scheduled to terminate after the expiration of such month, whichever is earlier. Failure to complete that training shall result in unpaid removal from any activities until completion of the distance learning.</p>
<p>2. Line Check Requirements</p>
<p>Line checks shall be administered by an appropriately qualified Check Airman or an FAA Air Carrier Inspector.</p>
<p>L. Requalification Training</p>
<p>1. If a pilot fails to meet the recency of experience requirements (becoming noncurrent) he shall be requalified in accordance with AQP source documents. However, a pilot whose landing currency has lapsed, while away from base on a trip, may continue by performing the duties and responsibilities of a Relief Flight Officer (RFO/RF2) only. This provision shall only be applicable in the event of extenuating circumstances (e.g., trip revision). Upon completion of that trip the pilot must complete requalification training before being assigned to any further activities.</p>
<p>2. If a pilot fails to complete recurrent training within his eligibility period (becoming overdue) he shall be requalified in accordance with AQP source documents.</p>
<p>3. [Reserved]</p>
<p>4. Failure to complete requalification training shall be addressed by the TRB.</p>
<p>5. If a pilot is in an unqualified status due to recurrent training failure, and has an interruption in training (e.g., sick leave, leave of absence, disability), he must complete the requalification training previously underway before he is eligible for an award of any other crew position.</p>
<p>M. Check Airmen (PCA/LCA/SCA/APD)</p>
<p>1. A Check Airman who evaluates and instructs Captains and/or First Officers shall:</p>
<p>a.   Be currently qualified in the Captain crew status; and</p>
<p>b.   Hold the Captain crew status, if an LCA, SCA, or APD; and</p>
<p>c.   Except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11O" target="_blank">Section 11.O.</a>, have a minimum of:</p>
<p>i. 300 hours as PIC in the aircraft in which he performs LCA duties if it is the pilot’s first Company employment as an LCA; or</p>
<p>ii.    150 hours as PIC in the aircraft in which he performs LCA duties, if the pilot has been an LCA within the last 5 years.</p>
<p>2. A Check Airman who evaluates Captains may also conduct line evaluations on other crew seats in that aircraft type. When a Captain or First Officer is being evaluated, all other crew seats are also being evaluated. This provision shall not be construed to permit an F/O PCA to conduct Line Checks.</p>
<p>3. The duties and the conditions of a Check Airman’s employment shall be at the discretion of the appropriate Standards or Training Manager, however, those duties and conditions may not contradict provisions of this Agreement. Check Airmen hold their positions at the discretion of the appropriate Standards or Training Manager.</p>
<p>4. Check Airmen may be qualified as a PCA, LCA, SCA, and/or APD.</p>
<p>5. A Check Airman who is bidding for flying purposes shall bid on and be awarded a bid period schedule in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</p>
<p>6. The number of pay only months for an LCA shall not exceed 2 per calendar year unless waived by the LCA. The following shall apply for an LCA when he is bidding in a pay only status in order to perform LCA duties:</p>
<p>a. When assigned flight duties in an aircraft (other than fly days), the maximum number of duty days on an LCA’s schedule shall be determined by dividing his pay only BLG/RLG by 6:24 CH rounded to the nearest whole number, provided the maximum number of duty days shall not exceed the maximum number of R-days in the bid period. The minimum number of duty days shall be 12 in a 4-week bid period, 15 in a 5-week bid period, and 19 in a 6-week bid period.</p>
<p>b. He may designate up to 5 days off in a 4-week bid period, 7 days off in a 5-week bid period, and 8 days off in a 6-week bid period (which may not be in more than 2 blocks) on his awarded schedule to be days free of duty on his revised schedule. He may provide primary and secondary requests for the specific days off, and the Company shall accommodate 1 of those requests. If 2 or more LCAs request the same days off, those requests shall be considered in seniority order.</p>
<p>c. He shall be notified of his pay only schedule as soon as practicable, but at least 72 hours prior to commencement of the bid period.</p>
<p>d. The Company may reschedule an LCA on a trip by trip basis to perform LCA duties with prior approval from the appropriate Flight Training Manager, or his designee. He shall be given at least 8 hours’ notice prior to a domestic trip or 12 hours’ notice prior to an international trip. An LCA shall not be required to work on a previously scheduled day(s) off without his consent.</p>
<p>e. The notice required in Section 11.M.6.c. and 11.M.6.d. may be waived at the LCA’s option.</p>
<p>f. Any reserve days on an LCA’s schedule shall be scheduled in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11N14" target="_blank">Section 11.N.14.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11N15" target="_blank">15.</a>, however assignments shall be limited to training events only.</p>
<p>7. The Company shall not place a Check Airman in pay only status for more than 2 consecutive bid periods without his concurrence. However, if it is necessary to place a Check Airman (except for those qualified only as LCAs) in pay only status for more than 2 consecutive bid periods, the Company may fill those requirements in inverse seniority order.</p>
<p>8. In order to provide an opportunity for pay only Check Airmen to maintain line proficiency in their respective aircraft, the following shall apply to all Check Airmen, except those qualified only as LCAs:</p>
<p>a.   During a Check Airman’s third consecutive pay only bid period, he shall be scheduled for 2 PDO fly days in lieu of scheduled training events, subject to the limitations contained in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11M9" target="_blank">Section 11.M.9.</a> (PDO Bid Period). Due to the lengths of trips in certain domiciles, PDO fly days may be pooled to accommodate a trip longer than 2 days.</p>
<p>b.   During a Check Airman’s fourth consecutive pay only bid period, he shall have eligibility equal to the CH value of 2 R-days (or a minimum of 4:30 CHs/day) available to him in the Secondary Working Window (SWW, see <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E6" target="_blank">Section 25.E.6.</a>) (SWW Bid Period). The Check Airman’s schedule shall include 2 fewer instructional days in an SWW Bid Period, unless deferred in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11M10b" target="_blank">Section 11.M.10.b.</a></p>
<p>c.   For each additional consecutive pay only bid period, the Check Airman’s proficiency flying eligibility shall alternate between PDO and SWW Bid Periods. When a Check Airman flexes back to line flying (i.e., is awarded a line for flying purposes) and he subsequently flexes back to his instructional duties (i.e., is awarded a line for pay only purposes), he will again be eligible for proficiency flying after his 3rd consecutive pay only bid period. However, he will resume the alternating proficiency flying pattern established when he was last eligible for proficiency flying.</p>
<p>Example: A Check Airman is scheduled for 4 consecutive pay only instructional bid periods (January, February, March, and April). March shall be a PDO Bid Period and April shall be a SWW Bid Period.</p>
<p>Example: A Check Airman is scheduled for 3 consecutive pay only instructional bid periods (January, February, and March). March shall be a PDO Bid Period. In April, the Check Airman is flexed back to line flying. The Check Airman is flexed back to instructional activities in May and is scheduled for 4 consecutive pay only instructional bid periods (May, June, July, and August). July shall be a SWW Bid Period and August shall be a PDO Bid Period.</p>
<p>d.   In order to maintain currency, proficiency with line operating policies and procedures, and enhance his professional capabilities, each Check Airman shall seek to attain 100 block hours (reducible by 2 hours per landing) per calendar year in the crew status in which he conducts training.</p>
<p>e.   When a Check Airman’s schedule includes a combination of instruction/evaluation flying events, and simulator and/or ground training events (i.e., “combo line”), that schedule shall not be considered as a “pay only bid period” for the purposes of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11M8" target="_blank">Section 11.M.8.</a></p>
<p>9. The following shall apply to all Check Airmen, except for those qualified only as LCAs, during a PDO Bid Period:</p>
<p>a.   A Check Airman may bump another pilot from his assigned trip(s) in order to maintain his proficiency in the crew status in which he conducts training.</p>
<p>b.   No pilot may be bumped without his consent.</p>
<p>c.   Check Airmen may PDO bump a pilot in any base.</p>
<p>d.   A Check Airman may bump a seat in which he is qualified but cannot hold based on his system seniority, but only if an LCA, SCA, or PCA (who is a Captain by seniority) occupies the other seat.</p>
<p>10.    The following shall apply to all Check Airmen, except for those qualified only as LCAs, during a SWW Bid Period:</p>
<p>a.   A Check Airman’s schedule shall include 2 fewer days, unless deferred as provided in Section 11.M.10.b. below;</p>
<p>b.   A Check Airman may defer the schedule reduction that otherwise would occur, in accordance with Section 11.M.10.a., in order to be entitled – in a subsequent, pay only bid period – to an aggregate schedule reduction of no more than 8 days.</p>
<p>Example: A Check Airman is placed in pay only status for a third consecutive bid period (which, based on the pattern established in Section 11.M.8., is an SWW Bid Period), and as such is entitled to a 2-day schedule reduction. He elects to defer that reduction, so his instructional schedule is not reduced. During his next SWW Bid Period, he elects not to defer, and also elects to use the previously deferred 2-day reduction. His training schedule for that bid period will be reduced by a total of 4 days.</p>
<p>c.   A Check Airman will have corresponding proficiency (PRO) flying eligibility during the SWW (see <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E6" target="_blank">Section 25.E.6.</a>) as follows:</p>
<p>i. For each day by which a pay only Check Airman’s schedule is reduced, as provided in Section 11.M.10.a., as applicable, the CH value of an R-day (or a minimum of 4:30 CH) shall be available for participation in the Secondary Working Window (SWW) (See <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E6" target="_blank">Section 25.E.6.</a>), and a corresponding, temporary BLG reduction shall also occur (subject to the proficiency flying/secondary line process immediately below);</p>
<p>ii.    The eligibility will also include the CHs previously deferred as provided in Section 11.M.10.b. above, but in no case shall the eligibility exceed 36 CH (at which time the pilot must exercise his PRO flying eligibility);</p>
<p>iii.   During the SWW, this eligibility may be used to preference trips from open time, which will be assigned using the PRO assignment code. The pilot may not voluntarily use, toward his secondary line construction, standby trips, R-day blocks, or Relief Flight Officer (RFO/RF2) trips. The PRO assignment code will have the same pay characteristics as TRP;</p>
<p>iv.    PRO eligibility shall be exercised at the pilot’s relative seniority;</p>
<p>v. PRO eligibility may be exceeded by as much as 9 CH for each bid period in which such eligibility is exercised; and</p>
<p>vi.    When a Check Airman is assigned to an R-day(s), through this process, he shall either:</p>
<p>(a)  notify his Training or Standards Manager, no later than the last Friday prior to the start of the bid period in which such R-day(s) occur, to have such R-day(s) be dropped without pay and eligible for make-up; or</p>
<p>(b)  have zero leveling on the first such R-day, and shall be in First Fly status for each such R-day.</p>
<p>d.   In no event shall a pilot begin a pay only SWW bid period below the applicable Minimum Bid Period Guarantee, subject to the provisions of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4A" target="_blank">Section 4.A.</a></p>
<p>11.    A Check Airman shall be notified of his pay only status at least 48 hours prior to the opening of the monthly bid, unless waived. The following shall apply for a Check Airman when he is bidding in a pay only status in order to perform Check Airman duties.</p>
<p>a. The maximum number of scheduled duty days shall not exceed the maximum number of R-days in the bid perio<a id="_idTextAnchor320"></a>d.</p>
<p>b.   Pay only carryover CHs shall be deposited into the Check Airman’s General Make-up Bank (GMB).</p>
<p>c.   A Check Airman bidding in pay only status may designate days free from duty as follows:</p>
<p>i. Up to 5 days off, which may not be in more than 2 blocks, in a 4-week bid period; or</p>
<p>ii.    Up to 7 days off, which may not be in more than 2 blocks, in a 5-week bid period; or</p>
<p>iii.   Up to 8 days off, which may not be in more than 2 blocks, in a 6-week bid period.</p>
<p>He may provide primary and secondary requests for the specific days off, and the Company shall accommodate 1 of those requests. If 2 or more Check Airmen request the same days off, those requests shall be considered in seniority order.</p>
<p>d. A Check Airman bidding in pay only status shall be notified of his pay only schedule as soon as practicable, but no later than 72 hours prior to the beginning of the bid period.</p>
<p>e.   If he so desires, a Check Airman may pick up an instruction/evaluation activity by using credits in his General Make-Up Bank (GMB). Such activity does not constitute an excess of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11M6a" target="_blank">Section 11.M.6.a.</a> (maximum number of scheduled duty days). The applicable credit hour deduction(s) from his GMB for such activity shall be calculated using the same values as set forth in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11M17c" target="_blank">Section 11.M.17.c.</a></p>
<p>f.   A Check Airman awarded a pay only line, for a bid period in which he is not initially scheduled to perform any instructional or evaluation duties in an aircraft, may be scheduled in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11N13" target="_blank">Section 11.N.13.</a></p>
<p>12. When assigned a combination of flight duties in an aircraft and other duties in a training base in a single pay only bid period, a combination of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11M6a" target="_blank">Section 11.M.6.a.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11M16" target="_blank">Section 11.M.16.</a> shall be used to determine the maximum number of events on a Check Airman’s schedule.</p>
<p>13.    The Company may reschedule or cancel a Check Airman on an event-by-event basis (trip or training activity) to perform Check Airman duties with prior approval from the appropriate Standards or Training Manager, or his designee. Assignments that occur as a result of this provision shall be limited to the event type canceled (e.g., If the Company cancels a SIM event, the Check Airman shall be available for only SIM assignments). He shall be given at least 8 hours’ notice prior to a domestic trip/training activity or 12 hours’ notice prior to an international trip. A Check Airman shall not be required to work on a previously scheduled day(s) off without his consent, subject to the provisions of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12A8" target="_blank">Section 12.A.8.</a></p>
<p>14.    Except for trips included on his awarded schedule during a non-instructional bid period, in the event that a Check Airman’s instruction/evaluation event (trip or training activity) is canceled, the Check Airman will be assigned instructional reserve days as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11N14" target="_blank">Section 11.N.14.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11N15" target="_blank">15.</a></p>
<p>15. The notice required in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11M13" target="_blank">Section 11.M.13.</a> above may be waived at the Check Airman’s option.</p>
<p>16.    The Company may assign a maximum of 15 instructional days in a 4 week bid period, 19 instructional days in a 5-week bid period, and 23 instructional days in a 6-week bid period.</p>
<p>17. A Check Airman shall be compensated as follows:</p>
<p>a. A Check Airman bidding in a flying status shall be compensated the BLG/RLG of his awarded bid period schedule plus additional compensation, if any, to which he is entitled, as provided in Sections 3 and 4.</p>
<p>b.   A Check Airman bidding in a pay only status shall receive the BLG/RLG of his awarded pay only bid period schedule as published in his monthly bid period package, plus additional compensation, if any, to which he is entitled as provided in Sections 3 and 4.</p>
<p>c.   A Check Airman bidding in a pay only status shall accrue, toward his BLG/RLG, the credit hour value for the following training activities:</p>
<p>i. the actual credit hour (ACH) value for a line trip(s) assigned by Flight Training Scheduling; and</p>
<p>ii.    R-day value for all other events.</p>
<p>d.   A Check Airman bidding in a pay only status shall be compensated as follows for all credit hours earned in a bid period for training activities occurring on days off (except for training activities assigned in Make-Up status), as defined by his originally published schedule:</p>

<p>g. In the case of an initial or higher-level qualification, a Check Airman candidate shall be paid the bid period override for that qualification upon commencement of his required training. Once qualified, a Check Airman’s Bid Period Override shall be administered in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11M17i" target="_blank">Section 11.M.17.i.</a></p>
<p>h.   In addition to all other compensation to which he is entitled, a Check Airman shall receive a bid period override commencing with his first month in the program. If a Check Airman is sick for an extended time (60 calendar days or greater) and is incapable of performing duties as assigned, his bid period override will be stopped effective on the first day of the first full bid period following 90 calendar days of the date he called sick in VIPS. His bid period override will be resumed on the first day of the first full bid period after the pilot is released to return to work.</p>
<p>i.   The bid period override for Check Airmen shall be:</p>
<p>Year 1 = $1,500</p>
<p>Year 2 = $1,600</p>
<p>Year 3 = $1,700</p>
<p>Year 4 and above = $1,900</p>
<p>18. A Check Airman is eligible to participate in System Bids that close during his tenure as a Check Airman, but will not receive an actual award without a release from his Standards or Training Manager, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11Q1" target="_blank">Section 11.Q.1.</a></p>
<p>19.    A Check Airman who elects to resign his position must notify the Standards or Training Manager at least 3 bid periods in advance.</p>
<p>a. The notification period may be reduced at the discretion of the Standards or Training Manager.</p>

<p>c.   The Check Airman is eligible to participate, without restriction, in any System Bid which closes subsequent to the effective date of his resignation.</p>
<p>d.   The crew position of a Check Airman who resigns, or is released from his Check Airman status absent an open System Bid or CIPPA crew position, shall be determined by comparing his system-wide seniority against the results of the most recent System Bid. If the pilot is awarded or assigned a different crew position than his current crew position, his training, or base transfer activation, shall be determined in the same manner as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_13A6e" target="_blank">Section 13.A.6.e.</a></p>
<p>20. Bid periods in which a Check Airman is scheduled for an awarded vacation shall be non-pay only bid periods to the greatest extent practical. A Check Airman, however, who is bidding for pay only during a month in which he has vacation, shall have his bid period schedule reduced, day for day, by the number of days in his vacation period. His vacation bank shall be reduced by R-day value for each day of vacation.</p>
<p>21.    A Check Airman on sick leave shall have his sick bank reduced by the value of the scheduled trip/training activity for each event missed due to sick.</p>
<p>22.    A Check Airman may trade training assignments by coordinating the trade with the applicable training scheduler, and with the approval of the appropriate Standards or Training Manager.</p>
<p>23.    When a Check Airman is assigned to instruct at a location other than his assigned training base, every day beginning with the first day of travel and ending on the day of return shall be considered a duty day for scheduling and compensation purposes. A Check Airman traveling to/from training at a location other than his assigned training base shall be scheduled for deadheads in accordance with Sections 8 and 12, as if he were deadheading to/from normal revenue operations, and:</p>
<p>a. Upon arrival at the training location, he shall be given a 12 hour duty free period prior to commencing any brief or training; and</p>
<p>b. At the completion of any brief, training, or reserve period, he shall be given a 12 hour duty free period before being scheduled for return travel.</p>
<p>24.    By mutual consent of the Check Airman and the appropriate Standards or Training Manager, a Check Airman may be assigned a training base different from his flying base (e.g., LAX based pilot assigned to the MEM training base, or MEM based pilot assigned to ANC training base, etc.). In such case, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>a.   A Check Airman’s assigned training base will not change during his tenure of service, unless mutually agreed upon by the Check Airman and the appropriate manager.</p>
<p>b.   All training activities including travel to offsite training locations shall originate and end in the Check Airman’s assigned training base.</p>
<p>c.   Travel between the Check Airman’s assigned training base and his flying base shall not be considered a duty day for scheduling purposes.</p>
<p>d.   Deviation shall be permitted to and from the assigned training base or offsite training location using training travel bank which includes:</p>
<p>i.   travel between the assigned training base and offsite training in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11M23" target="_blank">Section 11.M.23.</a>; and</p>
<p>ii.  1 round trip ticket per pay only month between his assigned training base and flying base.</p>
<p>e.   The provisions of Sections 5.A. and B. shall not apply while an Check Airman is performing duties in his assigned training base.</p>
<p>25.    Unless waived by mutual consent (Check Airman and appropriate Standards or Training Manager), a Check Airman shall maintain his originally scheduled simulator period over consecutive days. The Company may revise the period to either the immediate earlier period or immediate subsequent period, once during the consecutive days. Any further revision during the consecutive days is limited to a return to the originally scheduled simulator period. This paragraph shall not apply to extra training (ET) administered following a training failure, or to training administered following an “incomplete” event.</p>
<p>26.    If a Check Airman who is in TDNIF status is not current, he shall be permitted to provide simulator/ground instruction.</p>
<p>27.    Bid periods in which a Check Airman is scheduled for an awarded vacation shall be non-instructional bid periods to the greatest extent practical. A Check Airman, however, who is utilized for training during a month in which he has vacation shall have his bid period schedule reduced, day for day, by the number of days in his vacation period. His vacation bank shall be reduced by an R-day value for each day of vacation. A Check Airman:</p>
<p>a.   May adjust his vacation period by sliding it up to a maximum of 5 days in either direction, in accordance with Section 7; and</p>
<p>b.   Shall receive, if requested, a 48 hour duty free vacation buffer at each end of his vacation period. A vacation buffer shall not extend outside the bid period(s) in which the vacation occurred. A vacation buffer shall not create a conflict with a trip that began in the previous bid period.</p>
<p>28.    The Company may deadhead a Check Airman to an off site location per <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11N19" target="_blank">Section 11.N.19.</a></p>
<p>29.    A Standards Check Airman (SCA) or a Check Airman qualified as an Aircrew Program Designee (APD) shall receive an additional $600 per bid period.</p>
<p>N.   Instructor Pilots</p>
<p>1. An Instructor Pilot shall be current and qualified in the aircraft on which he instructs, and shall have a minimum of:</p>
<p>a.   300 hours in the aircraft in which he performs Instructor Pilot duties if it is the pilot’s first Company employment as an Instructor Pilot; or</p>
<p>b.   150 hours in the aircraft in which he performs Instructor Pilot duties if the pilot has been an Instructor Pilot within the last 5 years.</p>
<p>2. An Instructor Pilot who is in TDNIF status may not be current, in which case he shall be permitted to instruct.</p>
<p>3. An Instructor Pilot’s duty day (for non-flying events) may be scheduled for up to 8 hours, exclusive of 1 hour lunch break, with device training not to exceed 5 hours exclusive of brief/debrief.</p>
<p>4. The duties and the conditions of an Instructor Pilot’s employment shall be at the discretion of the appropriate Standards or Training Manager, however, those duties and conditions may not contradict provisions of this Agreement.</p>
<p>5. An Instructor Pilot shall bid on and be awarded a bid period schedule in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>a.   The appropriate Training Manager, or his designee, shall determine the monthly requirement for Instructor Pilots in a pay only status and coordinate the rotation of those Instructor Pilots on a monthly basis, and consistent with the provisions and limitations of this Agreement.</p>
<p>b.   If an Instructor Pilot is assigned to perform instructor duties for an entire bid period (instructional bid period), he shall bid for a pay only line.</p>
<p>c.   An Instructor Pilot shall be notified of his pay only status at least 48 hours prior to the opening of the monthly bid, except by mutual consent.</p>
<p>6. In the event that an Instructor Pilot’s activity is canceled, he will be assigned instructional reserve days as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11N14" target="_blank">Section 11.N.14.</a></p>
<p>7. An Instructor Pilot shall not be scheduled to perform instructor duties during non-instructional bid periods without his consent. If he consents to perform those duties he shall be removed from his conflicting scheduled trip(s) and/or R-day(s) as necessary to perform such duties, and shall be paid in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11N25aiv" target="_blank">Section 11.N.25.a.iv.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11N25av" target="_blank">v.</a>, as applicable.</p>
<p>8. The Company shall not place an Instructor Pilot in pay only status for more than 2 consecutive bid periods without his concurrence. However, if it is necessary to place an Instructor Pilot in pay only status for more than 2 consecutive bid periods, the Company may fill those requirements in inverse seniority order.</p>
<p>9. In order to provide an opportunity for pay only Instructor Pilots to maintain line proficiency in their respective aircraft, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>a.   During an Instructor Pilot’s third consecutive pay only bid period, he shall be scheduled for 2 PDO fly days in lieu of scheduled training events, subject to the limitations contained in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11N10" target="_blank">Section 11.N.10.</a> (PDO Bid Period). Due to the lengths of trips in certain domiciles, PDO fly days may be pooled to accommodate a trip longer than 2 days.</p>
<p>b.   During an Instructor Pilot’s fourth consecutive pay only bid period, he shall have eligibility equal to the CH value of 2 R-days (or a minimum of 4:30 CHs/day) available to him in the Secondary Working Window (SWW) (See <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E6" target="_blank">Section 25.E.6.</a>) (SWW Bid Period). The Instructor Pilot’s schedule shall include 2 fewer instructional days in an SWW Bid Period, unless deferred in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11N11b" target="_blank">Section 11.N.11.b.</a></p>
<p>c.   For each additional consecutive pay only bid period, the Instructor Pilot’s proficiency flying eligibility shall alternate between PDO and SWW Bid Periods. When an Instructor Pilot flexes back to line flying (i.e., is awarded a line for flying purposes) and he subsequently flexes back to his instructional duties (i.e., is awarded a line for pay only purposes), he will again be eligible for proficiency flying after his 3rd consecutive pay only bid period. However, he will resume the alternating proficiency flying pattern established when he was last eligible for proficiency flying.</p>
<p>Example: An Instructor Pilot is scheduled for 4 consecutive pay only instructional bid periods (January, February, March, and April). March shall be a PDO Bid Period and April shall be a SWW Bid Period.</p>
<p>Example: An Instructor Pilot is scheduled for 3 consecutive pay only instructional bid periods (January, February, and March). March shall be a PDO Bid Period. In April, the Instructor Pilot is flexed back to line flying. The Instructor Pilot is flexed back to instructional activities in May and is scheduled for 4 consecutive pay only instructional bid periods (May, June, July, and August). July shall be a SWW Bid Period and August shall be a PDO Bid Period.</p>
<p>d.   In order to maintain currency, proficiency with line operating policies and procedures, and enhance his professional capabilities, each Instructor Pilot shall seek to attain 100 block hours (reducible by 2 hours per landing) per calendar year in the crew status in which he conducts training.</p>
<p>10.    The following shall apply to all Instructor Pilots during a PDO Bid Period:</p>
<p>a.   An Instructor Pilot may bump another pilot from his assigned trip(s) in order to maintain his proficiency in the crew status in which he conducts training.</p>
<p>b.   No pilot may be bumped without his consent.</p>
<p>c.   An Instructor Pilot may PDO bump a pilot in any base.</p>
<p>d.   An Instructor Pilot may bump a seat in which he is qualified but cannot hold based on his system seniority, but only if an LCA, SCA, or PCA (who is a Captain by seniority) occupies the other seat.</p>
<p>11.    The following shall apply to all Instructor Pilots during a SWW Bid Period:</p>
<p>a.   An Instructor Pilot’s schedule shall include 2 fewer days, unless deferred as provided in Section 11.N.11.b.</p>
<p>b.   An Instructor Pilot may defer the schedule reduction that otherwise would occur, in accordance with Section 11.N.11.a., in order to be entitled – in a subsequent, pay only bid period – to an aggregate schedule reduction of no more than 8 days.</p>
<p>Example: An Instructor Pilot is placed in pay only status for a third consecutive bid period (which, based on the pattern established in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11N9" target="_blank">Section 11.N.9.</a>, is an SWW Bid Period), and as such is entitled to a 2-day schedule reduction. He elects to defer that reduction, so his instructional schedule is not reduced. During his next SWW Bid Period, he elects not to defer, and also elects to use the previously deferred 2-day reduction. His training schedule for that bid period will be reduced by a total of 4 days.</p>
<p>c.   An Instructor Pilot will have corresponding proficiency (PRO) flying eligibility during the SWW (see <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E6" target="_blank">Section 25.E.6.</a>) as follows:</p>
<p>i. For each day by which a pay only Instructor Pilot’s schedule is reduced, as provided in Section 11.N.11.a., as applicable, the CH value of an R-day (or a minimum of 4:30 CH) shall be available for participation in the Secondary Working Window (SWW), and a corresponding, temporary BLG reduction shall also occur (subject to the proficiency flying/secondary line process immediately below);</p>
<p>ii.    The eligibility will also include the CHs previously deferred as provided in Section 11.N.11.b., but in no case shall the eligibility exceed 36 CH (at which time the pilot must exercise his PRO flying eligibility);</p>
<p>iii.   During the SWW, this eligibility may be used to preference trips from open time, which will be assigned using the PRO assignment code. The pilot may not voluntarily use, toward his secondary line construction, standby trips, R-day blocks, or Relief Flight Officer (RFO/RF2) trips. The PRO assignment code will have the same pay characteristics as TRP;</p>
<p>iv.    PRO eligibility shall be exercised at the pilot’s relative seniority;</p>
<p>v. PRO eligibility may be exceeded by as much as 9 CH for each bid period in which such eligibility is exercised; and</p>
<p>vi.    When an Instructor Pilot is assigned to an R-day(s), through this process, he shall either:</p>
<p>(a)  notify his Training manager, no later than the last Friday prior to the start of the bid period in which such R-day(s) occur, to have such R-day(s) be dropped without pay and eligible for make-up; or</p>
<p>(b)  have zero leveling on the first such R-day, and shall be in First Fly status for each such R-day.</p>
<p>d.   In no event shall a pilot begin a pay only SWW bid period below the applicable Minimum Bid Period Guarantee, subject to the provisions of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4A" target="_blank">Section 4.A.</a></p>
<p>12.    Pay only carryover CHs shall be deposited into the Instructor Pilot’s General Make-up Bank (GMB).</p>
<p>13. In anticipation of an instructional bid period, for Instructor Pilots (and certain Check Airman, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11M11f" target="_blank">Section 11.M.11.f.</a>) who are not initially scheduled for instructional duties or evaluations in an aircraft:</p>
<p>a.   Training schedules shall be published at least 120 hours prior to the start of the bid period.</p>
<p>b.   During an instructional bid period, the Company shall construct a schedule of instructional duty days for each Instructor Pilot, and the following shall apply:</p>
<p>i. An Instructor Pilot bidding in pay only status may designate days free from duty as follows:</p>
<p>(a)  Up to 5 days off, which may not be in more than 2 blocks, in a 4-week bid period; or</p>
<p>(b)  Up to 7 days off, which may not be in more than 2 blocks, in a 5-week bid period; or</p>
<p>(c)  Up to 8 days off, which may not be in more than 2 blocks, in a 6-week bid period.</p>
<p>He may provide primary and secondary requests for the specific days off, and the Company shall accommodate 1 of those requests. If 2 or more Instructor Pilots request the same days off, those requests shall be considered in seniority order.</p>
<p>ii.    The Company may assign a maximum of 15 instructional days in a 4-week bid period, 19 instructional days in a 5-week bid period, and 22 instructional days in a 6-week bid period, except where otherwise further limited by <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11N11" target="_blank">Section 11.N.11.</a></p>
<p>iii.   If he so desires, an Instructor Pilot may pick up an instructional activity by using credits in his General Make-Up Bank (GMB). Such activity does not constitute an excess of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11N13bii" target="_blank">Section 11.N.13.b.ii.</a> (maximum number of scheduled duty days). The applicable credit hour deduction from his GMB shall be R-day value for each such activity.</p>
<p>14. Instructional reserve periods assigned to an Instructor Pilot or Check Airman shall be limited to instruction/evaluation duties, shall be the same period when scheduled on consecutive days, and may be designated as either:</p>
<p>a.   Instructional reserve periods are:</p>
<p>i. IR-A: 0200-1359 LBT; and</p>
<p>ii.    IR-B: 1400-0159 LBT.</p>
<p>b.   Notification windows are:</p>
<p>i. IR-A: 2200-0959 LBT; and</p>
<p>ii.    IR-B: 1000-2159 LBT.</p>
<p>c.   Pilots on instructional reserve must be given at least 4 hours’ notice prior to an event. This notice can be waived by the pilot for seat support events.</p>
<p>15.    Flight Training Scheduling (FTS) may change a pilot’s instructional reserve period (to/from IR-A, IR-B), consistent with the provisions of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25M3d" target="_blank">Section 25.M.3.d.i. through vi.</a></p>
<p>16.    Unless waived by mutual consent (Instructor Pilot and Training Manager), an Instructor Pilot shall be scheduled to conduct training in the same simulator period over a block of consecutive instructional days. The Company may revise the period to either the immediate earlier period, or the immediate subsequent period once during the block of consecutive days. Any further revision during the block of consecutive days shall be limited to a return to the originally scheduled simulator period. This paragraph shall not apply to extra training (ET) administered following a training failure, or to training administered following an “incomplete” event.</p>
<p>17.    When an Instructor Pilot is assigned to instruct at a location other than his assigned training base, every day beginning with the first day of travel and ending on the day of return shall be considered a duty day for scheduling and compensation purposes. An Instructor Pilot traveling to/from training at a location other than his assigned training base shall be scheduled for deadheads in accordance with Sections 8 and 12, as if he were deadheading to/from normal revenue operations, and:</p>
<p>a. Upon arrival at the training location, he shall be given a 12 hour duty free period prior to commencing any brief or training; and</p>
<p>b. At the completion of any brief, training, or reserve period, he shall be given a 12 hour duty free period before being scheduled for return travel.</p>
<p>18. By mutual consent of the Instructor Pilot and the appropriate Training Manager, an Instructor Pilot may be assigned a training base different than his flying base (e.g., LAX based pilot assigned to the MEM training base, or MEM based pilot assigned to ANC training base, etc.). In such case, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>a. An Instructor Pilot’s assigned training base will not change during his tenure of service within the Flight Training Department, unless mutually agreed upon by the Instructor Pilot and the Training Manager.</p>
<p>b.   All training activities including travel to offsite training locations shall originate and end in the Instructor Pilot’s assigned training base.</p>
<p>c. Travel between his assigned training base and his flying base shall not be considered a duty day for scheduling purposes.</p>
<p>d. Deviation shall be permitted to and from the assigned training base or offsite training location using training travel bank which includes:</p>
<p>i. travel between the assigned training base and offsite training in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11N17" target="_blank">Section 11.N.17.</a>; and</p>
<p>ii. one round trip ticket per pay only month between his assigned training base and flying base.</p>
<p>e.   The provisions of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_5A" target="_blank">Section 5.A.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_5B" target="_blank">B.</a> shall not apply while an Instructor Pilot is performing duties in his assigned training base.</p>
<p>19. Emergency Draft Off Site</p>
<p>Recognizing that emergencies may occur that could effectively stop an entire training/validation/evaluation evolution, an Instructor Pilot or Check Airman may be deadheaded to an off site location as soon as practicable to replace an individual and the following shall apply:</p>
<p>a. Deadhead travel shall be scheduled in accordance with Sections 8 and 12, except as provided below.</p>
<p>b. Combined deadhead duty time and training/validation/evaluation shall not exceed 12 hours.</p>
<p>c. The training/validation/evaluation evolution, if performed on the day of arrival, cannot exceed 6 hours, inclusive of brief and debrief.</p>
<p>d. One hour showtime for deadhead travel to off site location and 30 minutes after block-in from deadhead return shall be used when determining the time away from base for compensation purposes.</p>
<p>e. The Instructor Pilot or Check Airman will be afforded layover accommodations following his training/validation/evaluation evolution for a minimum of 10 hours crew rest.</p>
<p>f. The Instructor Pilot or Check Airman will be compensated at 150% for the duration of the assignment.</p>
<p>g. An Instructor Pilot or Check Airman shall not be required to accept an emergency draft off site.</p>
<p>20. To the greatest extent possible, the Company shall provide an Instructor Pilot at least 12 hours’ notice when his scheduled duty period changes by more than 6 hours. If the Instructor Pilot chooses not to accept the change, he has 90 days to coordinate with his scheduler and make up the event.</p>
<p>21.    [Reserved]</p>
<p>22. An Instructor Pilot may trade instructor assignments by coordinating the trade with the applicable training scheduler and with the approval of his<a id="_idTextAnchor369"></a> Standards or Training Manager.</p>
<p>23.    An Instructor Pilot may agree to reschedule his assigned duty days. An Instructor Pilot shall not be entitled to additional compensation as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11N25aiii" target="_blank">Section 11.N.25.a.iii.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11N25bii" target="_blank">b.ii.</a>, as a result of the application of this paragraph, provided he receives his original number of scheduled days off.</p>
<p>24. Bid periods in which an Instructor Pilot is scheduled for an awarded vacation shall be non-instructional bid periods to the greatest extent practical. An Instructor Pilot, however, who is utilized for training during a month in which he has vacation shall have his bid period schedule reduced, day for day, by the number of days in his vacation period. His vacation bank shall be reduced by an R-day value for each day of vacation. An Instructor Pilot:</p>
<p>a.   May adjust his vacation period by sliding it up to a maximum of 5 days in either direction, in accordance with Section 7; and</p>
<p>b.   Shall receive, if requested, a 48 hour duty free vacation buffer at each end of his vacation period. A vacation buffer shall not extend outside the bid period(s) in which the vacation occurred. A vacation buffer shall not create a conflict with a trip that began in the previous bid period.</p>
<p>25. An Instructor Pilot shall be compensated as follows:</p>
<p>a. During a bid period when an Instructor Pilot is scheduled to be on the line and bidding for flying purposes (i.e., a non-instructional bid period), an Instructor Pilot shall be compensated:</p>
<p>i. As provided in Sections 3 and 4 of this Agreement, when he is not performing Instructor Pilot duties;</p>
<p>ii.    If he so desires, he may pick up a training activity by using credits in his General Make-Up Bank. The credit hour deduction from his GMB shall be R-day value for each such training activity.</p>
<p>iii. If he agrees to perform Instructor Pilot duties on a day(s) off, he shall be compensated:</p>
<p>(a) R-day value at 150% of his normal rate of pay, for direct student contact and non-instructional seat support; and</p>
<p>(b) R-day value at his normal rate of pay for all other events.</p>
<p>iv. If he agrees to perform Instructor Pilot duties in lieu of a scheduled trip, he shall be compensated the value of the trip missed and may be used over the entire footprint of the scheduled trip.</p>
<p>v. If he agrees to perform Instructor Pilot duties on his scheduled R-day(s), an R-day value shall be credited toward his leveling and RLG (or mini RLG as appropriate) for each such R-day.</p>
<p>b. During an instructional bid period, an Instructor Pilot shall be compensated as follows:</p>
<p>i. An Instructor Pilot shall bid for a pay only line, and shall receive the BLG/RLG for his awarded (pay only) line, as published in his monthly bid period package, plus additional compensation, if any, to which he is entitled, as provided in Sections 3 and 4. Pay only carryover CHs on an Instructor Pilot’s awarded pay only line shall be deposited into his general make-up bank.</p>
<p>ii.    If he agrees to perform Instructor Pilot duties on a day(s) off, in excess of his required number of work days, he shall be compensated:</p>
<p>(a)  R-day value for direct student contact activities and non-instructional seat support at 150% of his normal rate of pay for each day; and</p>
<p>(b)  R-day value at his normal rate of pay for all other events.</p>
<p>c. In the case of an initial or higher level qualification, an Instructor Pilot candidate shall be paid the bid period override for that qualification upon commencement of his required training. Once qualified, an Instructor’s Bid Period Override shall be administered in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11N25e" target="_blank">Section 11.N.25.e.</a></p>
<p>d.   In addition to all other compensation to which he is entitled, an Instructor Pilot shall receive a bid period override commencing with the first month in the program. If an Instructor Pilot is sick for an extended time (60 days or greater) and is incapable of performing duties as assigned, his bid period override will be stopped effective on the first day of the first full bid period following 90 calendar days from the date he called sick in VIPS. His bid period override will be resumed on the first day of the first full bid period after the pilot is released to return to work.</p>
<p>e.   The bid period override shall be:</p>
<p>Year 1 = $1,000</p>
<p>Year 2 = $1,100</p>
<p>Year 3 = $1,200</p>
<p>Year 4 and above = $1,300</p>
<p>26. An Instructor Pilot may participate in System Bids that close during his tenure as an Instructor Pilot, but will not receive an actual award without a release from his Training Manager as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11Q1" target="_blank">Section 11.Q.1.</a></p>
<p>27.    An Instructor Pilot that elects to resign his position must notify his Training Manager at least 3 bid periods in advance.</p>
<p>a. The notification period may be reduced at the discretion of his manager.</p>
<p>b. The Instructor Pilot may be retained in his position for up to 3 months beyond his desired resignation date at the discretion of his manager or 6 months by mutual consent.</p>
<p>c.   The instructor is eligible to participate, without restriction, in any System Bid which closes subsequent to the effective date of his resignation.</p>
<p>d.   The crew position of an Instructor Pilot who resigns, or is released from his Instructor Pilot status absent an open System Bid or CIPPA crew position, shall be determined by comparing his system-wide seniority against the results of the most recent System Bid. If the pilot is awarded or assigned a different crew position than his current crew position, his training, or base transfer activation, shall be determined in the same manner as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_13A6e" target="_blank">Section 13.A.6.e.</a></p>
<p>28. Instructor Pilots hold their positions at the discretion of the Training Manager.</p>
<p>29. An Instructor Pilot on sick leave shall have his sick bank reduced by the value of the scheduled activity for each event missed due to sick.</p>
<p>30.    Bumping a Captain or First Officer seat which the Instructor Pilot is qualified for but cannot hold based upon his system seniority, shall require an LCA, SCA, or PCA (who is a Captain by seniority) to be in the other seat.</p>
<p>O. New Aircraft Entering Service</p>
<p>The provisions of Sections 9.A.1. (second sentence only), <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11M1b" target="_blank">11.M.1.b., and </a><a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11M1c" target="_blank">M.1.c.</a>, shall be waived in case of an aircraft type new to the Company fleet.</p>
<p>1. The Company selection of such pilot candidates to undergo type rating and Check Airman training must occur prior to the introduction of a new aircraft into revenue service. A pilot who did not bid the new aircraft in the initial System Bid and could have held such position, shall not be eligible to be an initial cadre Check Airman.</p>
<p>2. Initial cadre Check Airmen candidates who hold the crew status on the initial System Bid.</p>
<p>a.   After the closing of the initial System Bid, the Company shall notify the MEC Chairman in writing of those initial cadre Check Airmen candidates that have been awarded crew positions in the new aircraft in accordance with the provisions of Section 24 of the CBA within 60 days of the award.</p>
<p>b.   Initial cadre Check Airmen candidates who receive an award on the initial new aircraft System Bid (i.e., the candidate is awarded the necessary crew status to perform his duties as described in Section 11) shall be considered “Check Airmen.”</p>
<p>c.   Check Airmen will use normal bidding processes for BLG and schedule determination in accordance with the provisions of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11M5" target="_blank">Section 11.M.5.</a>, as applicable. A Check Airman shall bid in a pay only status in his previous crew position until the Company publishes a bid period package for the new aircraft type, at which point the Check Airman shall bid in the new aircraft crew position.</p>
<p>d.   A Check Airman’s hourly rate of pay shall be as provided in Section 3 except that a Check Airman will receive the higher of:</p>
<p>i. his pay rate at the time of selection as a Check Airman (regardless of whether it is derived from passover pay, CIPPA, or the crew position in which he is currently activated); or</p>
<p>ii.    the new aircraft pay rate, upon activation as a Captain in the new aircraft crew position.</p>
<p>Note: If the Check Airman is awarded/assigned from the crew position for which he was being compensated prior to entering the initial cadre, the pay rate comparison shall be between the crew position he was awarded/assigned as a result of the System Bid and the new aircraft pay rate.</p>
<p> Example: Pilot A, a 757 Captain, holds an award to A300 CAP and is receiving passover pay to A300 CAP. He was part of the initial cadre of Check Airmen for the 757. Under <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11O2dii" target="_blank">Section 11.O.2.d.ii.</a>, the Check Airman is initially compensated at the A300 CAP rate while working as a 757 Check Airman. Then, however, Pilot A is assigned from the A300 CAP seat to the MD-11 F/O seat. Pilot A is compensated as a 757 CAP under <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11O2dii" target="_blank">Section 11.O.2.d.ii.</a> in the same manner as that by which the “Nth” CIPPA positions are determined, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11Q3a" target="_blank">Section 11.Q.3.a.</a> (using MD-11 F/O as the “applicable crew position”).</p>
<p>e.   If the pilot resigns or is removed from the new aircraft training program, he may elect to remain in the crew position he was activated as a Check Airman and shall be compensated accordingly. If the pilot does not so elect, his crew position shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p>i. If the pilot holds no other award/assignment, he shall be placed in the crew position award/assignment he held immediately prior to the Check Airman crew status award and compensated accordingly; or</p>
<p>ii.    If the pilot holds an award/assignment other than the crew position in which he was activated immediately prior to the Check Airman crew status award, he shall be placed in such award and compensated accordingly.</p>
<p>iii.   The scheduling of training, or base transfer activation, required by application of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11O2ei" target="_blank">Section 11.O.2.e.i.</a> or ii. shall be determined in the same manner as <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_13A6e" target="_blank">Section 13.A.6.e.</a></p>
<p>f.   A Check Airman shall not incur a passover or CIPPA repayment or a down/lateral bid restriction relating to his participation as a Check Airman under <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11O" target="_blank">Section 11.O.</a></p>
<p>3. Initial cadre Check Airmen candidates who cannot hold the crew status on the initial System Bid.</p>
<p>a.   Initial cadre pilot candidates who are not able to hold an award in the initial new aircraft System Bid will be considered “Provisional Check Airmen” (or Provo). The Company may award Provos Captain crew positions as if they had been awarded such crew position from the initial new aircraft System Bid. Provos will be considered to hold a quasi-award to the new aircraft crew position for purposes of Sections 11.M. These positions will be in addition to the initial System Bid awards. The Company may use Provisional Check Airmen for a maximum of 24 bid periods beginning with the introduction of the new aircraft into revenue service. The Company shall notify the MEC Chairman in writing of those pilots that have been awarded crew positions in accordance with this paragraph within 60 days of the award.</p>
<p>b.   A Provo shall bid in a pay only status in his previous crew position until the Company publishes a bid period package for the new aircraft type, at which point the Provo shall bid for vacation in the new aircraft crew position, but shall receive average BLG (for pay only) for the new aircraft crew position. The Provo’s schedule shall be governed by the applicable provisions of Section 11 as if the Provo was bidding in pay only status. Any revenue flying assignments must be accomplished in accordance with the provisions of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25U" target="_blank">Section 25.U.</a> (Bumping for Training).</p>
<p>c.   During the 24 bid periods, a Provo shall have the ability to participate in all other System Bids as if the pilot was not a Provo.</p>
<p>d.   If the Provo receives a crew position award/assignment to the aircraft in which the pilot serves as a Provisional Check Airman, the crew status will no longer be considered “Provisional.”</p>
<p>e.   A Provisional Check Airman’s hourly rate of pay shall be as provided in Section 3, except that a Provo will receive the higher of:</p>
<p>i. His pay rate at the time of selection as a Provo (regardless of whether it is derived from passover pay, CIPPA, or the crew position in which he is currently activated); or</p>
<p>ii.    The new aircraft pay rate, upon “activation” as a Captain in the new aircraft crew position.</p>
<p>Note: If the Provo is awarded/assigned from the crew position for which he was being compensated prior to entering the initial cadre, the pay rate comparison shall be between the crew position he was awarded/assigned as a result of the System Bid and the new aircraft pay rate.</p>
<p>f.   A Provo shall cease to perform all Check Airman duties or be compensated as such upon the earlier of his resignation or removal from the program, or the expiration of 24 months after the introduction of the new aircraft into revenue service. The pilot’s crew position shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p>i. If the pilot holds no other award/assignment, the pilot shall be placed in the crew position award/assignment the pilot held immediately prior to the Provisional Check Airman crew status award and compensated accordingly; or</p>
<p>ii.    If the pilot holds an award/assignment other than the crew position in which the pilot was activated immediately prior to the Provisional Check Airman crew status award, the pilot shall be placed in such award and compensated accordingly.</p>
<p>iii.   The scheduling of training, or base transfer activation, required by application of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11O3fi" target="_blank">Section 11.O.3.f.i.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11O3fii" target="_blank">ii.</a> shall be determined in the same manner as <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_13A6e" target="_blank">Section 13.A.6.e.</a></p>
<p>g.   A Provo shall not incur a passover or CIPPA repayment obligation or a down/lateral bid restriction relating to the pilot’s participation as a Provo under <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11O" target="_blank">Section 11.O.</a></p>
<p>4. If a System Bid includes a crew position(s) for which the Current Staffing Level is greater than the published Maximum Staffing Level:</p>
<p>a.   An initial cadre Provisional Check Airman shall be considered to be in the pool for which the Provo holds a crew position award/assignment (not the quasi-award);</p>
<p>b.   An initial cadre Check Airman shall be considered to be in the pool of pilots in the crew position for which the pilot is receiving the pay rate (e.g., a MD-11 MEM Captain, selected as an initial cadre pilot candidate, holds an award on the initial System Bid for the 757 MEM Captain, and receives, through the operation of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11O" target="_blank">Section 11.O.</a>, the pay rate for an MD-11 Captain; if a System Bid publishes a Current Staffing Level greater than Maximum Staffing Level, in the MD-11 MEM Captain crew position, the pilot will be considered as participating in that pool, and not as a 757 MEM Captain). If the pilot’s participation in that System Bid was in the crew position for which the pilot is performing duties as a Check Airman, the Company may continue to use the pilot as a Check Airman if the pilot is re-designated a Provo. In such case, the Company may continue to use the (newly designated) Provo until the expiration of 24 months following the introduction of the new aircraft into revenue service or 6 months after the close of that System Bid, whichever is later.</p>
<p>5. Line Pilots</p>
<p>All pilots who hold an award from the initial System Bid, and who will not be Check Airmen, will be classified as Line Pilots.</p>
<p>a.   In addition to other provisions of the Agreement, for each Provisional Check Airman who has been “activated” in the crew position as allowed under <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11O3" target="_blank">Section 11.O.3.</a>, and for each Check Airman who activated earlier than his seniority would have dictated, one Line Pilot who holds an award for the new aircraft crew position will be entitled to the new aircraft pay rate if it is higher than their present rate.</p>
<p>i. The rate assignment for the Line Pilots shall be determined by seniority order.</p>
<p>ii.    For each additional Provo “activated” and Check Airman who activated into the new aircraft crew position earlier than his seniority would have dictated, the next most senior Line Pilot will begin receiving the new aircraft pay rate.</p>
<p>iii.   When a Line Pilot receiving the new aircraft pay rate under this paragraph is no longer eligible for the rate due to activation, retirement, withdrawal from training, or an award/assignment to a different crew position, then the next most senior Line Pilot, if any, who was not previously receiving the new aircraft pay rate, shall begin receiving it.</p>
<p>iv.    Notwithstanding Section 11.O.5.a.iii., if a Provo ceases to be “provisional” (e.g., activates into the new aircraft crew position pursuant to an award/assignment commensurate with the pilot’s seniority or activates in another aircraft after leaving the new aircraft training program), that Provo shall not generate a new aircraft pay rate for any new additional Line Pilots.</p>
<p>v. Notwithstanding Section 11.O.5.a.iii., once an out-of-seniority Check Airman reaches the point at which he would have been activated in seniority order or activates in another aircraft after leaving the new aircraft training program, that Check Airman shall not generate a new aircraft pay rate for any new additional Line Pilots.</p>
<p>b.   For Line Pilots receiving the new aircraft pay rate in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11O5a" target="_blank">Section 11.O.5.a.</a>, such pay shall end upon the earlier of:</p>
<p>i. the Line Pilot’s activation into the new crew position for which the Line Pilot is receiving the new aircraft pay rate;</p>
<p>ii.    the Line Pilot’s withdrawal or removal from training; or</p>
<p>iii.   the Line Pilot’s projected activation date from the original System Bid (i.e., into the crew position that generated the new aircraft pay rate), if the Line Pilot receives a different intervening award.</p>
<p>P.   General</p>
<p>1. For purposes of Section 11, “current crew position” is not intended to indicate that the pilot presently maintains FAR currency.</p>
<p>2. Training and validations/evaluations administered to non-pilots may not be conducted in Company aircraft during revenue operations.</p>
<p>3. Continuing qualification simulator events for Instructor Pilots and non-pilot instructors shall be administered by a Check Airman.</p>
<p>4. An Instructor Pilot, or other pilot (as provided in Section 25), may provide seat support for a student pilot during the simulator phase of ITU and all recurrent training events. An Instructor may support simulator phase ITU events except the Maneuvers Validation (MV) and all subsequent simulator events. Notwithstanding the above, an Instructor may provide seat support after the MV for any non-Evaluation/Validation maneuvers events.</p>
<p>5. An Instructor Pilot is required for all Continuing Qualification (CQ) simulator training events. During the simulator phase of ITU, an Instructor Pilot shall conduct the Maneuvers Validation (MV), and all subsequent simulator events. Notwithstanding the above, an Instructor may conduct any non-Validation/Evaluation maneuvers events including those subsequent to the MV.</p>
<p>The Company’s ability to assign an Instructor to conduct non-Validation/Evaluation Continuing Qualification (CQ) simulator event(s) resulting from a revision(s) to the CQ curriculum shall be subject to the process described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11A3a" target="_blank">Section 11.A.3.a.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11A3b" target="_blank">b.</a></p>
<p>6. All training and validation/evaluation events conducted in aircraft shall be administered by a line check qualified Check Airman or an FAA Air Carrier Inspector, subject to the following:</p>
<p>a. Such training and validation/evaluation events for Captains and First Officers shall be administered by a pilot who holds and is currently qualified in the Captain crew status on the aircraft, or by an FAA Air Carrier Inspector;</p>
<p>b. Any crew seat not occupied by a pilot in training shall be occupied by a pilot who is current and qualified in that crew seat, except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11P6c" target="_blank">Section 11.P.6.c.</a> below.</p>
<p>c. During a Captain’s OE validation, the First Officer seat must be occupied by an appropriately qualified Check Airman.</p>
<p>7. All crew seats shall be occupied during simulator validation/evaluation events.</p>
<p>a. During such simulator validation/evaluation events for a Captain or First Officer crew seat, the Captain and First Officer seats, if not occupied by a pilot being validated/evaluated, shall be occupied by a pilot(s) currently qualified in that crew seat(s) or, in the case of an ITU train to proficiency validation event, by an Instructor who is qualified in that crew seat(s).</p>
<p>b. Reserve pilots, who have voluntarily indicated a preference, may be assigned to provide seat support during simulator validation/evaluation events.</p>
<p>8. Any simulator training period may be audio or video recorded with the written permission of all the pilots involved; provided, however, that such audio or video recording is erased after being viewed and critiqued by the pilots involved. A validation/evaluation event shall not be audio or video recorded.</p>
<p>9. A pilot assigned to occupy a crew seat in support of another pilot’s training session/validation/evaluation event is not required to participate in the ground validation (e.g., walk-around inspection, emergency equipment) administered by the Instructor during the pre-simulator briefing. The assigned pilot shall satisfy the performance standards required by his crew status. Should the pilot flying seat support encounter any significant performance issues that require training (other than debrief), prior to his return to line flying, his case shall be referred to the TRB. A pilot shall not incur a training failure while occupying a seat in support of another pilot’s training.</p>
<p>10. Casual observers are not permitted in a simulator during a training period or validation/evaluation event without the mutual agreement of all pilots receiving training. FAA Air Carrier Inspectors, Check Airmen, instructors receiving training, pilot managers, Association representative (if requested by trainee), or other Company employees receiving required training are not considered casual observers.</p>
<p>11. Notwithstanding <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11P10" target="_blank">Section 11.P.10.</a>, and available seating permitting, a Check Airman or Instructor Pilot may observe, at the request of a pilot, his flight simulator training, aircraft training, OE or validation/evaluation event. In those cases, a Check Airman/Instructor Pilot is not entitled to additional compensation.</p>
<p>12. Upon request, a pilot receiving training or a validation/evaluation event in a simulator or aircraft shall be granted one change of instructor or Check Airman in the simulator, aircraft or OE phases of ITU training.</p>
<p>13. No simulator validation/evaluation events shall be scheduled to be conducted between 0001 LT and 0500 LT, including brief.</p>
<p>14. [Reserved]</p>
<p>15. A pilot who is subject to a freeze in accordance with Section 11 shall be released from that freeze if he is assigned or furloughed from his crew status, or can no longer hold that crew status due to legal restrictions. Notwithstanding other provisions of Section 11, a pilot may be assigned or awarded a crew status that he is otherwise “permanently ineligible” to hold if that crew status is the only crew status he could hold.</p>
<p>16. Except for de-identified training data, which is not covered by this paragraph, the Company shall retain only training records required by law (including FAA and other governmental agency regulation(s)).</p>
<p>17. A pilot may have Association representation at any conference with management involving unsatisfactory training performance. Meetings shall not be delayed unreasonably because of the need for representation.</p>
<p>18. Proficiency Enhancement Partnership Program</p>
<p>As part of its proficiency enhancement partnership program, the Company will offer the following additional training for proficiency (non-jeopardy training) at the pilot’s election and subject to availability. This training is entirely voluntary on the pilot’s part. The pilot shall not be paid for this training, nor shall it count as duty or a day of work for purposes of this Agreement. The Company shall make a good faith effort to accommodate a pilot’s request for scheduling this type of training, however, this training shall not be scheduled to create a conflict with any other scheduled activities, and will be subject to device and instructor availability. The Company shall offer the following two types of training pursuant to this program:</p>
<p>a. ITU Audit</p>
<p>A pilot holding an ITU award may audit ground school before the commencement of his training, and may select PRO, MAN, and OE events subject to the discretion of the training manager.</p>
<p>b. Proficiency Enhancement</p>
<p>Up to two times per year, a pilot may request proficiency enhancement training. Pilots shall not request proficiency enhancement training to occur within 30 days of scheduled recurrent training.</p>
<p>Q. Check Airman/Instructor Pilot Pay Adjustment (CIPPA)</p>
<p>1. As provided in Sections 11.M.18. and N.26., Check Airmen and Instructor Pilots may participate in System Bids, but will only receive an actual award if released by the appropriate Standards or Training Senior Manager. An assignment to a crew position pursuant to Section 24 will be considered an actual assignment.</p>
<p>2. If a Check Airman or Instructor Pilot is not released, he shall receive a notional award. In such case, he shall be eligible for CIPPA if the notional crew position award has an hourly rate of pay higher than:</p>
<p>a.   His current crew position, if he is not – at the time of the System Bid’s closing – eligible for passover pay or CIPPA based upon a crew position whose hourly rate of pay is higher than his current crew positon; or</p>
<p>b.   His currently awarded crew position, if he is eligible for passover pay.</p>
<p>3. The Company shall administer CIPPA as follows:</p>
<p>a.   A Check Airman or Instructor Pilot eligible for CIPPA will have his system-wide seniority compared against those who received an actual award to the applicable crew position, along with other Check Airmen and Instructor Pilots who are eligible for CIPPA based upon the same crew position, in order to establish their “Nth” CIPPA position. An eligible pilot will begin to receive CIPPA either:</p>
<p>i. Upon the Nth actual pilot activation into the applicable crew position, following the close of the applicable System Bid; or</p>
<p>ii.    90 days following the close of the applicable System Bid, if the eligible pilot was the most senior in the comparison (i.e., “Nth”=1st).</p>
<p>b.   CIPPA shall continue until the earlier of:</p>
<p>i. The date as of which there are no longer any junior pilots activated in the crew position;</p>
<p>ii.    The date as of which there would no longer be any junior pilot activated in the crew position, but for the junior pilot(s)’ unavailability;</p>
<p>iii.   The closing date of a subsequent System Bid, in which he was again not released to receive an actual award (i.e., a new, intervening CIPPA eligibility);</p>
<p>iv.    The effective date of the pilot’s release or resignation from his Check Airman or Instructor Pilot status; or</p>
<p>v. The first day following the 24th bid period in which the pilot received CIPPA. The pilot shall also be given notification, in that 24th bid period, of his release from Check Airman or Instructor Pilot status in accordance with 11.Q.3.d. below.</p>
<p>c.   In the event a CIPPA eligible pilot is not released to receive an actual award in another, subsequent System Bid, as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11Q2" target="_blank">Section 11.Q.2.</a>, he shall begin to receive his intervening CIPPA consistent with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11Q3a" target="_blank">Section 11.Q.3.a.</a></p>
<p>d.   A CIPPA eligible pilot who exhausts the full 24 bid periods described in Section 11.Q.3.b.v. above shall be released from his Check Airman or Instructor Pilot status, and he shall enter the pool of ITU training bidding in the same manner as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_13A6e" target="_blank">Section 13.A.6.e.</a> for the notional crew position award upon which his CIPPA was most recently based.</p>
<p>Note: The bid periods during which a pilot is not collecting CIPPA, because of an intervening CIPPA trigger, do not count toward the 24 month limit.</p>
<p>e.   A pilot’s monthly CIPPA dollar amount shall be determined by comparing his currently awarded crew position to his currently awarded notional (i.e., CIPPA eligible) crew position, and using the corresponding value in the SDP chart found in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24E" target="_blank">Section 24.E.</a></p>
<p>f.   CIPPA shall be paid on a monthly basis in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_3E1a" target="_blank">Section 3.E.1.a.</a></p>
<p>g.   Repayment of CIPPA by Check Airmen or Instructor Pilots shall be exclusively limited to situations in which:</p>
<p>i. The pilot subsequently is awarded, during his receipt of CIPPA, a crew position whose hourly rate of pay is lower than the one upon which his CIPPA is based; or</p>
<p>ii.    The pilot withdraws from training for the crew status upon which his CIPPA was based, unless extenuating circumstances existed for such withdrawal (<a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11J2a" target="_blank">Section 11.J.2.a.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11J3" target="_blank">Section 11.J.3.</a>).</p>
<p>R.   Ongoing Implementation Measures</p>
<p>The parties recognize that the matters governed by Section 11 are complicated and that the new provisions of Section 11 require significant changes to existing systems and practices. As a result, the parties foresee that flexibility will be required in order to ensure the smoothest possible transition to the new provisions of Section 11. To that end, measures facilitating the implementation, operation, or administration of the provisions in Section 11 may be implemented if agreed upon in writing by the Vice President, Labor Relations and the Association’s MEC Chairman.</p>

<!-- SECTION 12 -->
<div class="four" id="section12">
<h1 class="persist-header">Section 12: Hours of Service</h1>
<p>A.   General</p>
<p>1. Flying (Non-Company)</p>
<p>a.   This Agreement contemplates that pilots shall devote their entire professional flying service to the Company, except that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a pilot from affiliating with the military service of the United States.</p>
<p>b.   Pilots shall not fly aircraft other than those operated by the Company for hire or remuneration unless authorized by the Vice President, Flight Operations, or his designee.</p>
<p>c.   Except for Company flight operations, a pilot shall not perform flying which would count toward his FAR regulated block hours or duty time limitations. This does not restrict a pilot who is a member of a military guard or reserve organization in the flying of military aircraft.</p>
<p>2. Except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12B3aiii" target="_blank">Section 12.B.3.a.iii.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12B3ciii" target="_blank">B.3.c.iii.</a> (Airport Standby), and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25M1g" target="_blank">Section 25.M.1.g.</a> (Reserve), a pilot shall be subject to operational limitations during a duty period within a trip. At all other times, a pilot shall be subject to scheduled limitations.</p>
<p>3.   Operational Emergency</p>
<p>If the Company’s operations are disrupted due to extenuating circumstances not within the control of the Company, including, but not limited to, severe weather, natural disasters, abnormal ATC limitations or significant system disruptions, the Vice President, Flight Operations, or his designee, may declare an operational emergency. When an operational emergency is declared, all flight, duty time and rest limitations may be extended/reduced to FAR limits, except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D9" target="_blank">Section 12.D.9.</a> An operational emergency may be declared for a specific sort facility, a region of the system, nationwide or worldwide. In addition, the Company shall communicate the reasons for an operational emergency as soon as practicable but no later than 72 hours following the declaration thereof. In case of an operational emergency declared under this paragraph, the processes described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C5bii" target="_blank">Section 12.C.5.b.ii.</a> (domestic) and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D6cii" target="_blank">12.D.6.c.ii.</a> (international) shall apply.</p>
<p>4. A legal rest period shall not be considered interrupted when the Company:</p>
<p>a.   provides a wake-up (alert) call to the pilot:</p>
<p>i. no earlier than 2 hours prior to showtime for an international duty period; or</p>
<p>ii.    more than 2 hours prior to showtime as required by <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D1g" target="_blank">Section 12.D.1.g.</a> in situations involving ground transit time exceeding 1 hour; or</p>
<p>b.   leaves any form of non-verbal communication for a pilot staying at a hotel, e.g., note under the door, phone light; or</p>
<p>c.   attempts to leave a message by telephone for a pilot at a location other than a hotel; or</p>
<p>d.   attempts to notify a pilot of a personal emergency.</p>
<p>5. Maximum Landings</p>
<p>a.   A pilot shall not be scheduled to exceed 3 landings, as part of an operating crew, in a duty period that begins in the critical period. If a pilot is scheduled for 3 landings as described above, his next duty period that begins in the critical period in that trip shall have 2 or fewer landings, unless the pilot had an intervening critical period free from duty.</p>
<p>b.    A pilot shall not be scheduled to exceed 4 landings, as part of an operating crew, in any duty period that touches the critical period.</p>
<p>c.   A pilot shall not be scheduled to exceed 5 landings, as part of an operating crew, in any duty period.</p>
<p>d.   A domestic multiple day trip shall not be scheduled for a cumulative total of more than 12 landings in the critical period, unless approved by the SIG.</p>
<p>e.   The landing limits in this paragraph may be increased by 1 operationally.</p>
<p>6. Operational Trip Return to Base</p>
<p>a.   Should an operational circumstance arise which requires a flight to return to base (or remain there) with no other intermediate destination (e.g., not block out, return to blocks prior to take-off while at base, air turn-back to base), the trip is not terminated, and CRS has the following options:</p>
<p>i. revise the trip to block out in that duty period;</p>
<p>ii.    revise the trip to block out after a legal rest period at base; or</p>
<p>iii.   remove the pilot, in which case the pilot:</p>
<p>(a)  shall be compensated the greater of 3 CH, ABH, or duty rig computed from his scheduled showtime until his actual release; and</p>
<p>(b)  shall be eligible for substitution, if applicable, for the balance of trip guarantee.</p>
<p>b.   Should an operational emergency be declared as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12A3" target="_blank">Section 12.A.3.</a> due to severe weather, mechanical difficulties, or other extenuating circumstances in a designated sort facility, flight crews may be rescheduled or diverted to their base. Under these circumstances, the pilot’s base will be treated as a normal alternate and not as a base. As such, the trip will not terminate, but will continue as if originally transiting the scheduled sort facility (i.e., hub turn outbound or layover in base as if the pilot was on a layover at the originally scheduled sort facility).</p>
<p>7. The Company shall provide a bid period report to the Association which indicates the dates, flights and relevant circumstances in which the Vice President, Flight Operations, or his designee, exercised his authority to operationally extend a pilot beyond the <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C5" target="_blank">Section 12.C.5. and </a><a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D6" target="_blank">12.D.6.</a> operational duty limitations or as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12B3biic" target="_blank">Section 12.B.3.b.ii.(c)</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12B3diic" target="_blank">Section 12.B.3.d.ii.(c)</a>, except for extensions due to an operational emergency declared under <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12A3" target="_blank">Section 12.A.3.</a></p>
<p>8. If a pilot’s trip is extended into time originally scheduled free from duty at base, such extension shall be limited to the following, unless the pilot consents to a longer extension:</p>
<p>a.    the Company may extend a pilot:</p>
<p>i. on a domestic trip up to 36 hours into time previously scheduled free from duty at base; or</p>
<p>ii.    on an international trip up to 84 hours into time previously scheduled free from duty at base.</p>
<p>b.   maintenance or weather disruptions particular to the pilot’s specific flight shall, but only to that limited extent, provide the Company with the ability to exceed the 36/84 hour limit without the pilot’s consent. Notifications of the use of this provision shall occur using the provisions of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12A7" target="_blank">Section 12.A.7.</a></p>
<p>9. Fatigue</p>
<p>a.    A pilot who is excessively tired prior to actual check-in for a trip in base following a legal rest period shall notify CRS immediately and speak to a Fleet Captain or the Duty Officer about his situation. The pilot will be removed from his trip and to the extent he had trip guarantee, the hours shall be eligible for make-up. If the trip was a reserve assignment, the underlying R-days will be dropped without pay, and the value of those R-days shall be eligible for make-up.</p>
<p>b.   A pilot who becomes excessively tired subsequent to actual trip check-in shall notify CRS immediately and talk to the Duty Officer about his situation. Depending on the pilot’s situation and the Duty Officer’s assessment, one of the following alternatives shall be enlisted to address the issue:</p>
<p>i. The pilot may be given a legal rest period. The pilot’s schedule thereafter may also be postponed until after the legal rest period is concluded.</p>
<p>ii.    The pilot’s current trip may be revised to include some alternative duty assignment.</p>
<p>iii.   The pilot may be removed from his trip and placed in sick leave status as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_14B5" target="_blank">Section 14.B.5.</a>, subject to <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12A9f" target="_blank">Section 12.A.9.f.</a> below; the pilot shall automatically be returned from sick leave at the conclusion of his trip.</p>
<p>c.   Deadheads that are necessary in any of the above situations shall be accomplished in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
<p>d.   In the event there are any questions about the pilot’s fatigue call, the Association members of the Fatigue Event Review Committee (FERC) may make the initial contact with the pilot to discuss the issue(s) further.</p>
<p>e.   The pilot shall submit a Fatigue Event Report, via appropriate Company automation, within 72 hours after his fatigue call.</p>
<p>f.   A pilot who calls fatigued away from base during a trip shall be treated in the same manner as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_14B4" target="_blank">Section 14.B.4.</a>, and shall have local transportation and lodging provided by the Company.</p>
<p>g.    The FERC shall meet and discuss all pilot fatigue calls made subsequent to actual trip check-in. For instances to which <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12A9biii" target="_blank">Section 12.A.9.b.iii.</a> applied, the FERC will evaluate the circumstances surrounding the fatigue call and will attempt to reach a consensus concerning compensation for that trip, or portion thereof, not operated owing to the fatigue call.</p>
<p>i. The FERC may decide to authorize compensation as follows:</p>
<p>(a)  With deduction of the applicable credit hours from the pilot’s sick bank; or</p>
<p>(b)  With no deduction from the pilot’s sick bank.</p>
<p>ii.    In the absence of consensus, the FERC shall refer the decision to the SCP.</p>
<p>10.    Fatigue Risk Management System (FRMS)</p>
<p>With the consent of the Association, the parties may examine pairings as part of the Fatigue Risk Management System as follows:</p>
<p>a.   For purposes of FRMS study, pairings shall be grouped into three categories:</p>
<p>Category 1:    Prospective ULR Pairings;</p>
<p>Category 2:    Prospective pairings that do not comply with either the FARs or the CBA or both; and</p>
<p>Category 3:    Prospective pairings which comply with both the FARs and the CBA.</p>
<p>b.   The Association consents to the study of ULR pairings (Category 1). Specific ULR pairing designs shall be approved in advance, unanimously by the Data Collection Steering Committee (DCSC) (e.g., flight sequence, layover times, location, departure and arrival times, time free from duty prior to and after the pairing). The DCSC will make decisions based upon available sleep science. Such pairings shall comply with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12E" target="_blank">Section 12.E.</a></p>
<p>c.   The parties shall agree to a methodology for the clear and uniform identification of FRMS study pairings.</p>
<p>d.   FRMS study pairings in Category 1 and 2 shall be offered to pilots on a strictly voluntary basis as agreed to by the parties.</p>
<p>e.   Reserve pilots will be assigned FRMS study pairings on a voluntary basis only.</p>
<p>f.   FRMS pairings will not be placed onto secondary lines unless specifically preferenced by the pilot.</p>
<p>g.   FRMS study pairings not assigned by the applicable assignment window, as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25G3a" target="_blank">Section 25.G.3.a.</a>, shall be:</p>
<p>i. Reconstructed to comply with the CBA and FARs, and assigned per the CBA; or</p>
<p>ii.    Notwithstanding <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25P" target="_blank">Section 25.P.</a>, assigned to management pilots as originally designed but without data collection. <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_9A3" target="_blank">Section 9.A.3.</a> shall not apply to management assignments pursuant to this paragraph.</p>
<p>h.   Pilots voluntarily operating Category 1 or 2 FRMS pairings shall be required to participate in the collection of human performance/alertness data, in accordance with and as required by the data collection protocols contained in the Collection of Human Performance/Alertness Data MOU. For Category 3 FRMS pairings, the Company shall not require participation in the collection of human performance/alertness data, but may solicit for such, as provided in Paragraph A.6. of the Collection of Human Performance/Alertness Data MOU.</p>
<p>i.   After appropriate testing and validation of such change(s) (as determined by the DCSC with the concurrence of the Fatigue Risk Management Group (FRMG)), the parties may seek to change provisions of this Agreement to the extent necessary to implement the tested and validated change(s). Any such changes shall be implemented if approved by the Company and the Association. The Association’s approval shall be sought in a manner deemed appropriate by the Association’s MEC (e.g., MOU, LOA, etc.).</p>
<p>j.   Association members of the DCSC and FRMG shall be removed from flying as provided for FOQA Gatekeepers under <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_18A2a" target="_blank">Section 18.A.2.a.</a> and shall be compensated and treated accordingly under <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_18B" target="_blank">Section 18.B.</a></p>
<p>11.    In the event the Company becomes subject to new flight and duty time regulations that restrict operations otherwise permitted by this Agreement, the Company and the Association will meet to discuss jointly pursuing FAA certification of the affected CBA provisions as an Alternative Means of Compliance (AMOC) in lieu of such new, otherwise restricting, regulations.</p>
<p>B.   Duty Period Limitations</p>
<p>1. Duty periods begin and terminate as follows:</p>
<p>a.   When the first activity in a duty period is flight deck duty, that duty period shall begin with a showtime 1 hour before the scheduled block-out or actual check-in time, whichever is later. Such duty period may begin with a showtime more than 1 hour prior to scheduled block-out if the time greater than 1 hour is designated as a standby period. Commencement of a duty period shall not be delayed if block-out is rescheduled after scheduled showtime or actual check-in, whichever is later. If a trip is designated for a potential early pull from a pilot’s base, the showtime will be revised accordingly.</p>
<p>Example: The scheduled block-out of 0900 is moved up to 0830. Showtime automatically moves up from 0800 to 0730, and this is not standby time. On the other hand, if the scheduled block-out remains at 0900 and the Company wants the pilot to show early at 0730, then the period between 0730 and 0800 is a standby period.</p>
<p>b.   When the first activity in a duty period is a deadhead by air, that duty period shall begin with a showtime at least 1 hour before the scheduled departure. Pilots may check in via VIPS in lieu of checking in at the FedEx operations area. The showtime for a deadhead sequence that begins with an intercontinental commercial deadhead segment shall be at least 1:30 hours prior to scheduled block-out.</p>
<p>c.   When the first activity in a duty period is a deadhead by surface transportation, that duty period shall begin at the scheduled or rescheduled time of pick up.</p>
<p>d.   When a deadhead precedes flight deck duty in the same duty period, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>i. If the deadhead is on a scheduled passenger air carrier, at least 1:30 (domestic)/2:00 (international) hours shall be scheduled between deadhead arrival and FedEx revenue flight block-out.</p>
<p>ii.    If the deadhead is on Company (freight) aircraft (operational deadheads), chartered jet aircraft, or non-freight Company jet aircraft, at least 1 hour shall be scheduled between block-in and block-out.</p>
<p>iii.   If the deadhead is a deadhead by surface transportation, at least 1 hour shall be scheduled between the surface deadhead arrival and block-out.</p>
<p>e.   When a deadhead follows flight deck duty in the same duty period, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>i. If the deadhead is on a scheduled passenger air carrier, at least 1:30 (domestic)/2:00 (international) hours shall be scheduled between block-in of the FedEx revenue flight and departure of the deadhead.</p>
<p>ii.    If the deadhead is on a chartered jet aircraft or non-freight Company jet aircraft, at least 1 hour shall be scheduled between block-in and block-out.</p>
<p>iii.   If the deadhead is on Company jet (freight) aircraft (operational deadhead), at least 30 minutes shall be scheduled between block-in and block-out.</p>
<p>iv.    If the deadhead is by surface transportation, 15 minutes shall be scheduled between block-in and the deadhead departure.</p>
<p>f.   Except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12B2" target="_blank">Section 12.B.2.</a>, when the last activity of a duty period is a deadhead by surface transportation that duty period shall terminate at the scheduled arrival time of the surface deadhead.</p>
<p>g.   When the last activity of a duty period is flight deck duty or deadhead by air, that duty period shall terminate 30 minutes after block-in.</p>
<p>2. If a pilot is delayed in the completion of his assigned duties beyond the scheduled or rescheduled termination time of his duty period (extended customs clearance, maintenance, surface deadhead), that duty period shall end at the completion of those duties, provided he notifies CRS of his actual termination time prior to entering legal rest.</p>
<p>3. Standby</p>
<p>a.   Base Airport Standby</p>
<p>i. A base airport standby duty period commences at showtime for the standby.</p>
<p>ii.    A base airport standby duty period in which the pilot is not assigned a trip shall not exceed 5 hours.</p>
<p>iii.   A base airport standby pilot may only be assigned a trip with a showtime during the 5 hour standby period (for revenue operations, scheduled block-out can be no later than 1 hour beyond the 5 hour standby period). If a pilot blocks out on that trip, he shall be subject to scheduled limitations for the entire duty period, unless extended to operational limitations with the prior approval of the Vice President, Flight Operations, or his designee.</p>
<p>iv.    The pilot shall be notified of an assignment at least 1 hour prior to scheduled block-out, unless the first leg of the assignment is deadhead by chartered aircraft or Company jumpseat, in which case the notification shall occur at least 45 minutes prior to scheduled block-out.</p>
<p>b.   Base Hotel Standby</p>
<p>i. A base hotel standby period shall not exceed 11:30 hours.</p>
<p>ii.   A base hotel standby pilot may only be assigned duty commencing during the standby period. If a pilot’s pairing is revised, however, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>(a)  If his next activity is a scheduled hotel standby and the standby is rescheduled to begin earlier, that new start time must be preceded by at least 12 hours free from duty.</p>
<p>(b)  If a pilot is given an assignment with a showtime prior to the start of his next scheduled standby period, that assignment must be preceded by 12 hours free from duty.</p>
<p>(c)  The 12 hour rest requirement provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12B3biia" target="_blank">Section 12.B.3.b.ii.(a)</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12B3biib" target="_blank">(b)</a> may be reduced to the rest requirements of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C6" target="_blank">Section 12.C.6.</a>, or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D7" target="_blank">12.D.7.</a>, as applicable.

<p>(d)  If the pilot returns to base within his standby period, the provisions of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12B3bvi" target="_blank">Section 12.B.3.b.vi.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12B3bvii" target="_blank">vii.</a>, and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12B3bviii" target="_blank">viii</a>. shall apply.</p>
<p>(e)  If a pilot is released early from his standby period, for purposes of this paragraph, that standby period ends upon his release.</p>
<p>iii.   A base hotel standby pilot shall be notified of an assignment at least 1:30 prior to scheduled block-out, unless the first leg of the assignment is deadhead by chartered aircraft or Company jumpseat, in which case the notification shall occur at least 45 minutes prior to scheduled block-out.</p>
<p>iv.    If assigned a trip, a base hotel standby pilot’s duty period shall begin at the showtime for that trip. If assigned a duty period that does not consist exclusively of a deadhead or operation as part of an augmented crew, the standby pilot shall be scheduled for release to a legal rest period not later than the scheduled on-duty limit for that showtime, but in any case, the standby pilot shall be released to a legal rest period not later than 4:30 hours after the end of his standby period.</p>
<p>v. If assigned to base airport standby duty, the pilot’s duty period shall begin at showtime of the airport standby. If a pilot is not assigned a trip, his airport standby shall terminate 5 hours after beginning duty for that standby or at the end of the base hotel standby period, whichever occurs first.</p>

<p>vii.   If a base hotel standby pilot performs a flight sequence originating at a layover station and returning to his base for the purpose of resuming hotel standby status in that duty period, his 11:30 base hotel standby period starts at the showtime for that flight sequence or the beginning of the originally scheduled standby period in the base hotel standby sequence, whichever occurs first. He shall contact CRS within 30 minutes following block-in.</p>
<p>viii.  If a pilot resumes base hotel standby duty as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12B3bvi" target="_blank">Section 12.B.3.b.vi.</a>, or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12B3bvii" target="_blank">vii.</a>, CRS may:</p>

<p>iii.   A field airport standby pilot may only be given a flight sequence with a showtime during the 5 hour standby period (for revenue operations, scheduled block-out can be no later than 1 hour beyond the 5 hour standby period). If he blocks out on the flight, he shall be subject to scheduled limitations for the entire duty period, unless extended to operational limitations with the prior approval of the Vice President, Flight Operations, or his designee.</p>
<p>iv.    A field airport standby pilot who performs a flight sequence originating in his standby city and returning to that city within the same 5 hour field airport standby period, shall contact CRS within 30 minutes following block-in.</p>
<p>v. If a pilot performs a flight sequence originating at a layover city and returning to the standby city for the purpose of resuming airport standby status in that duty period, his 5 hour field airport standby period starts at the showtime for that flight sequence or the beginning of the originally scheduled standby period in the field airport standby sequence, whichever occurs first. He shall contact CRS within 30 minutes following block-in.</p>

If a pilot resumes field hotel standby duty as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12B3dvi" target="_blank">Section 12.B.3.d.vi.</a>, or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12B3dvii" target="_blank">vii.</a>, CRS may:</p>
<p>(a)  hold the pilot for the remainder of his 11:30 field hotel standby period;</p>
<p>(b)  assign the pilot to further duty commencing within the 11:30 standby period; or</p>
<p>(c)  release the pilot to a legal rest period.</p>
<p>ix.    If a field hotel standby pilot returns to his base, unless he is released from the remainder of his trip by CRS, his trip shall not end as a result of returning to his base, notwithstanding the definition of a trip, and the following shall apply:</p>
<p>(a)  if the pilot is not returned to his field standby location by the end of his next duty period, then at the end of the subsequent duty period, either his trip shall end or he shall be returned to his standby location.</p>
<p>(b)  the pilot may be scheduled to layover in his base prior to the application of Section <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12B3dixa" target="_blank">12.B.3.d.ix.(a).</a></p>
<p>C.   Domestic Provisions</p>
<p>1. General</p>
<p>a.   Applicability</p>
<p>Domestic provisions apply to activities conducted entirely within the contiguous 48 states, and to trips constructed under <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D1b" target="_blank">Section 12.D.1.b.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D1c" target="_blank">c.</a> (International Provisions).</p>
<p>b.   1-in-7</p>
<p>A pilot shall be relieved from all duty for at least 24 consecutive hours at least once during any seven consecutive days.</p>
<p>c.   1-in-10</p>
<p>A pilot assigned exclusively to domestic trips within a period of 240 hours shall be scheduled to be relieved from all duty at his base for at least 24 consecutive hours at least once during that period. A pilot may waive the provisions of this paragraph to prevent a phase-in conflict, by indicating his waiver when he submits his bid. It shall not be a violation of this rule if a pilot would have received the relief from duty required by this paragraph but for a bid line adjustment, reassignment trip, or a volunteer or draft assignment.</p>
<p>2. Domestic Block Hour Limitations</p>
<p>a.   A pilot shall not be scheduled as an operating crew member in excess of 8 block hours during a single duty period or during any consecutive 24 hour period, except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C2b" target="_blank">Section 12.C.2.b.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C2d" target="_blank">d.</a></p>
<p>b.   A pilot may be scheduled as an operating crew member to exceed 8 block hours during any 24 consecutive hours. Prior to exceeding 8 ABH in that period, however, he shall have received an intervening legal rest period of twice the block hours flown since his last legal rest period, or 9 hours, whichever is greater, except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C2cii" target="_blank">Section 12.C.2.c.ii.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C2ciii" target="_blank">iii.</a></p>
<p>c.   A pilot originally scheduled under <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C2a" target="_blank">Section 12.C.2.a.</a>, or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C2b" target="_blank">b.</a>, but who, due to headwinds, ATC delays or other unavoidable circumstances (including an intermediate stop for these reasons) is projected to exceed the limitations contained in those paragraphs, may continue to the extent permitted by FAR regulations. Duty time and rest limitations as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C5" target="_blank">Section 12.C.5.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C6" target="_blank">C.6.</a> still apply.</p>
<p>i. A pilot who, due to headwinds, ATC delays or other unavoidable circumstances (including an intermediate stop for these reasons) is projected to exceed 8 ABH without an intervening legal rest period, shall be permitted to continue to base or to his layover station, whichever is scheduled to occur first, at which point he shall receive a legal rest period. However, a crew shall not block-out from a location after having exceeded 8 hours of block time in a 24 hour period without a legal rest period.</p>
<p>ii.    If a pilot is originally scheduled to exceed 8 block hours in 24 consecutive hours, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C2b" target="_blank">Section 12.C.2.b.</a>, but due to headwinds, ATC delays or other unavoidable circumstances (including any intermediate stops for these reasons), cannot receive the minimum required legal rest period, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>(a)  he may be rescheduled for a legal rest period of at least twice the block hours flown since his last legal rest period, but not less than 8 hours; or</p>
<p>(b)  his schedule may be revised to not exceed 8 block hours in 24 consecutive hours; or</p>
<p>(c)  he may be replaced (and shall earn trip guarantee).</p>
<p>iii.   If a pilot departs his base on a flight and makes an unscheduled return to that base without an intervening stop and he is then projected to exceed 8 block hours in that same duty period, the Company shall employ one of the following options:</p>
<p>(a)  reschedule the pilot so as not to exceed 8 block hours; or</p>
<p>(b)  schedule the pilot for a legal rest period at base to ensure future legality; or</p>
<p>(c)  remove the pilot, and, if he is not a MUV, MUS, CMU, AFB, VLT, or DRF pilot, he shall be eligible for substitution; or</p>
<p>(d)  remove the pilot, and, if he is a MUV, MUS, CMU, AFB, VLT, or DRF pilot, compensate him the greater of 3 CH, ABH or duty rig computed from his scheduled showtime until his actual release.</p>
<p>d.   The following provisions shall apply in place of Sections 12.C.2.b. and c. above, for a pilot whose trip (or series of trips) includes no duty (scheduled or actual) in the Critical Duty Period:</p>
<p>i. If his trip (or series of trips), as awarded/assigned, exceeds 7:35 block hours in 24 consecutive hours, during two consecutive Day Duty Periods, then:</p>
<p>(a)  Prior to exceeding 7:35 ABH during that 24 consecutive hour period, he shall have received an intervening legal rest period of at least 10:15, operationally reducible to 9:15;</p>
<p>(b)  As awarded/assigned, he may be scheduled for one additional flight segment after having exceeded 7:35 block hours during that 24 consecutive hour period. Operationally, however, he may block-out on two scheduled flight segments during the duty period after having exceeded 8 ABH during that 24 consecutive hour period, provided that his intervening rest (described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C2dia" target="_blank">Section 12.C.2.d.i.(a)</a>) was at least 10:15; and</p>
<p>(c)  He shall be scheduled for a rest period of at least 13:00 following that second consecutive Day Duty Period, operationally reducible to 12:00.</p>
<p>ii.    If his trip (or series of trips), as awarded/assigned, does not exceed 7:35 block hours in 24 consecutive hours, during two consecutive Day Duty Periods, but he actually accrues additional block time such that he is projected to exceed 8 ABH, then:</p>
<p>(a)  Prior to exceeding 8 ABH during that 24 consecutive hour period, he shall have received an intervening legal rest period of at least 10:15, operationally reducible to 9:15; and</p>
<p>(b)  He may not block-out on any additional flight segments after having exceeded 8 ABH in a 24 consecutive hour period without a legal rest period.</p>
<p>3. Domestic Crew Planning Limitations</p>
<p>Crew Planning limitations shall apply until 48 hours prior to showtime of a trip or series of trips, except that such limitations do not apply to a sequence of trips that includes an optional assignment (e.g., make-up, trip trade, volunteer or draft). Trips constructed and revisions that occur after that time shall be governed by <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4" target="_blank">Section 12.C.4.</a> through C.6., as applicable.</p>
<p>a. Layover Minimum</p>
<p>A layover preceding duty as an operating pilot shall be scheduled for at least 10:15 hours. A layover preceding deadhead duty may be scheduled to a minimum of 8 hours.</p>
<p>b. Anchor Zone Requirements</p>
<p>An anchor zone is an 8 hour period of time, scheduled free from duty, that is common throughout a specified sequence of layovers. An anchor zone is required if a pilot’s planned trip, or series of trips involves operation in the critical period. The following shall apply to trips requiring an anchor zone:</p>
<p>i.   The anchor zone shall be established based on the layover immediately preceding the first operation in the critical period and shall apply going forward only. If the first duty period in a trip or series of trips involves operation in the critical period, then the anchor zone is established based on the layover following such first operation in the critical period.</p>
<p>ii.  By providing a layover of 18 hours or greater, an anchor zone may be reset. If the anchor zone is reset, then for the purposes of the anchor zone concept, the remainder of the trip following the reset anchor zone is considered to be a separate trip. An anchor zone is not reset merely due to the existence of a layover of 18 hours or greater; an anchor zone is only considered reset if the anchor zone after the 18 hour layover does not share a common 8 hours with the anchor zone prior to the 18 hour layover.</p>
<p>iii. An anchor zone may not be reset more than once during any trip or series of trips.</p>
<p>iv.    For purposes of bid period package construction, an anchor zone reset within a trip or series of trips shall require approval of the SIG.</p>
<p>v.   An anchor zone is not required in a layover preceding a deadhead-only duty period that concludes a trip.</p>
<p>vi.  An anchor zone is not required on a standby trip.</p>
<p>c. Maximum Trip Length</p>
<p>A domestic trip shall not be scheduled for more than 204 hours TAFB.</p>
<p>d. Critical Period Operation with Deadhead Return</p>
<p>If flight deck duty occurs anytime in the critical period, there shall not be a following deadhead within the same duty period, except that the final duty period in a trip may contain such deadhead if the trip is scheduled to terminate in base prior to 1030 LBT and the duty period cannot be extended beyond normal scheduled duty limits to accomplish such.</p>
<p>e. Maximum Connect Time</p>
<p>When a deadhead follows flight deck duty in the same duty period, no more than 4 hours shall be scheduled between block-in of the FedEx revenue flight and departure of the deadhead.</p>
<p>f. Critical Period Out and Backs</p>
<p>Trips that depart base in the critical period and return to base in the same duty period (out and backs) shall be scheduled to block-in by 1000 LBT.</p>
<p>4. Domestic On-Duty Limitations (Scheduled)</p>
<p>a.   Day</p>
<p>If the showtime for a duty period is between 0500 and 1559 LBT, that duty period shall be limited to a maximum of 13 hours scheduled, except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4d" target="_blank">Sections 12.C.4.d.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4e" target="_blank">e.</a>, or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4f" target="_blank">f.</a></p>
<p>b.   Night</p>
<p>If the showtime for a duty period is between 1600 and 0059 LBT, that duty period shall be limited to a maximum of 11:30 hours scheduled, except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4d" target="_blank">Sections 12.C.4.d.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4e" target="_blank">e.</a>, or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4f" target="_blank">f.</a></p>
<p>c.   Critical</p>
<p>If the showtime for a duty period is between 0100 and 0459 LBT, that duty period shall be limited to a maximum of 9 hours scheduled, except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4g" target="_blank">Section 12.C.4.g.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4h" target="_blank">C.4.h.</a></p>
<p>d.   Blended Duty Requirements</p>
<p>Transitions between the scheduled duty limits set forth in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4a" target="_blank">Section 12.C.4.a.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4b" target="_blank">b.</a>, and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4c" target="_blank">c.</a> shall be as follows:</p>
<p>i. Day to night transition:    1515 to 1645 with 1:1 slope</p>
<p>ii.    Night to critical transition:   2230 to 0100 with 1:1 slope</p>
<p>iii.   Critical to day transition: 0500 to 0530 blend from 11 hours to 13 hours.</p>
<p>iv.    If a pilot’s duty period contains flight segments with at least 4 hours between block-in and block-out, and a day room is scheduled and reserved during that time, normal scheduled domestic on-duty limitations (not blended duty limitations) shall apply.</p>
<p align="center"><img align="center" alt="" src="./2015FDXCBA_web_files/cba2015_s12p1.png"/></p>
<p>e.   If a pilot’s duty period comprises portions of 2 trips (e.g., two trips hub turning), one of which is an optional assignment (e.g., make-up, trip trade, volunteer or draft), the following scheduled on-duty limitations apply:</p>
<p>i. If the duty period is less than the scheduled on-duty limitations of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4a" target="_blank">Section 12.C.4.a.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4b" target="_blank">b.</a> (i.e., 13 Day and 11:30 Night), then the applicable scheduled on-duty limit (i.e., 13 Day and 11:30 Night) shall still apply.</p>
<p>ii.   If the duty period comprised of 2 trips exceeds the scheduled on-duty limitations of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4a" target="_blank">Section 12.C.4.a.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4b" target="_blank">b.</a> (i.e., 13 Day and 11:30 Night), then the duty period shall be limited to a maximum of 13:30 (Day)/13:00 (Night) scheduled on-duty.</p>
<p>f.   If a duty period is comprised exclusively of deadhead, the scheduled on-duty limitations contained in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4a" target="_blank">Section 12.C.4.a.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4b" target="_blank">b.</a>, or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4c" target="_blank">c.</a> shall apply.</p>
<p>g.   Deadhead Following Revenue Flight</p>
<p>The following applies to a duty period which includes deadhead to base after revenue flight.</p>
<p>i. If the duty period began in the critical period, the entire duty period remains limited to 9 hours scheduled (i.e., no increased duty is permitted in order to deadhead).</p>
<p>ii.    If the duty period began in the day or night period, the entire duty period may be scheduled up to 2 hours beyond the scheduled limitations in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4a" target="_blank">Section 12.C.4.a.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4b" target="_blank">b.</a>, in order to accomplish the deadhead. However, the portion of the duty period prior to check-in for the deadhead shall be scheduled to the on-duty limitations contained in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4a" target="_blank">Section 12.C.4.a.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4b" target="_blank">b.</a>, as applicable.</p>
<p>h.   For purposes of revenue recovery, the Vice President, Flight Operations, or his designee, may authorize a trip to be scheduled up to operational limits in the critical period. This paragraph is for recovery purposes only; bid pack trips may not be scheduled this way.</p>
<p>i.   If a pilot is scheduled to deadhead to base after revenue flying, and his duty period exceeds 10 hours, he may obtain a hotel room at Company expense, in order to take a later flight, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_5B1f" target="_blank">Section 5.B.1.f.</a></p>
<p>j.    If a pilot transits a base within a single duty period, at least 1:30 hours shall be scheduled between block-in and block-out. This paragraph does not apply to a transit which does not involve a change of aircraft.</p>

<p>5. Domestic On-Duty Limitations (Operational)</p>
<p>a.   General Rule</p>
<p>A pilot shall not be operationally extended more than 1:30 past the applicable scheduled on-duty limitation, except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C5aii" target="_blank">Section 12.C.5.a.ii.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C5b" target="_blank">12.C.5.b.</a> The “applicable scheduled on-duty limitation” is the maximum scheduled on duty limitation in each category (i.e., day, night, critical, deadhead to base or optional trip trade, VLT, etc.), with reference to <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4a" target="_blank">Section 12.C.4.a.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4b" target="_blank">b.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4c" target="_blank">c.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4d" target="_blank">d.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4e" target="_blank">e.</a>, or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4f" target="_blank">f.</a>, except that if the scheduled duty limit is blended, then the operational duty limit shall be 1:30 more than that specific blended limit.</p>
<p>i. If a pilot’s duty period was properly scheduled as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4div" target="_blank">Section 12.C.4.d.iv.</a>, such pilot’s scheduled duty limit remains the maximum scheduled on duty limit for his category, regardless of operational events affecting the pilot’s scheduled ground time, or ability to use his day room (e.g., delayed inbound).</p>
<p>ii.    Reduced Operational Limit for Early Day Period Duties</p>
<p>(a)  If the showtime for a pilot’s duty period is between 0500 and 0530, his operational duty limit shall be :30 over his scheduled duty limit.</p>
<p>(b)  If the showtime for a pilot’s duty period is between 0531 and 0600, his operational duty limit shall be 1:00 over his scheduled duty limit.</p>
<p>b.   If the Company’s operations or flight(s) are disrupted due to extenuating circumstances not within the control of the Company, including, but not limited to, severe weather, natural disasters, ATC limitations or significant system disruptions, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>i. A pilot may, subject to <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C5bii" target="_blank">Section 12.C.5.b.ii.</a>, be scheduled to continue up to FAR duty limits, with the prior approval of the Vice President, Flight Operations, or his designee, if necessary to complete his scheduled or rescheduled flight sequence or return to base, whichever occurs first. Block time limitations as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C2c" target="_blank">Section 12.C.2.c.</a> still apply.</p>
<p>ii.    In the event of a trip delay, revision or operational emergency that extends, or would extend, a pilot beyond the operational limitations, a pilot who becomes excessively tired shall notify CRS immediately and then speak to the Duty Officer about his situation. Depending on the pilot’s situation and the Duty Officer’s assessment, one of the following alternatives shall be enlisted to address the issue:</p>
<p>(a)  The pilot’s duty may be revised to include some alternative duty that is at or within operational limits; or</p>
<p>(b)  The pilot may be given a legal rest period. In this case, the pilot’s schedule thereafter may be postponed until after the legal rest period is concluded.</p>
<p>(c)  Should it be determined that the pilot requires more rest than the legal rest provided pursuant to <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C5biib" target="_blank">Section 12.C.5.b.ii.(b)</a>, the pilot may be removed from the balance of his trip and be placed in sick leave status. If the pilot is placed in sick leave status the pilot shall be automatically returned from sick leave at the conclusion of his trip.</p>
<p>(d)  The FERC shall meet and discuss all instances to which <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C5bii" target="_blank">12.C.5.b.ii.</a> applied.</p>
<p>iii.   Deadheads that are necessary in any of the situations described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C5bii" target="_blank">Section 12.C.5.b.ii.</a> shall be accomplished in accordance with the Agreement.</p>
<p>iv.    Nothing in these paragraphs shall diminish a pilot’s responsibility to ensure that he has adequate rest prior to reporting for duty.</p>
<p>c.   The 1:30 buffer applicable to base transits may be operationally reduced to not less than 1 hour (CRS may provide the 1 hour minimum operational buffer by rescheduling the outbound segment of a hub turn).</p>
<p>6. Domestic Rest Provisions</p>
<p>a.   A domestic rest period shall be scheduled for not less than 9 hours (8 hours when the following duty period consists entirely of deadhead), and shall not be operationally less than 8 hours.</p>
<p>b.   A pilot who exceeds 8 ABH in any consecutive 24 hour period shall be scheduled for a rest period of:</p>
<p>i. 17 hours prior to performing his next duty as an operating crew member, when <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C2b" target="_blank">Sections 12.C.2.b.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C2c" target="_blank">c.</a> are applicable. This rest period may be operationally reduced as necessary, consistent with FAR limitations; or</p>
<p>ii.    13 hours prior to performing his next duty as an operating crew member, when <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C2di" target="_blank">Sections 12.C.2.d.i.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C2dii" target="_blank">ii.</a> are applicable. This rest period may be operationally reduced to 12 hours.</p>
<p>c.   If a pilot cannot be scheduled for a return deadhead within 4 hours after scheduled block-in of his last revenue flight, he shall be given a legal rest period prior to his return deadhead.</p>
<p>d.   If a pilot operationally receives a layover of less than 11 hours, immediately following operation in the critical period, his next layover must be at least 12 hours, unless the remainder of his trip contains only deadheading, except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12A3" target="_blank">Section 12.A.3.</a> (operational emergency).</p>
<p>D.   International Provisions</p>
<p>1. General</p>
<p>a.   Except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D1b" target="_blank">Section 12.D.1.b.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D1c" target="_blank">c.</a>, international provisions apply to flight activities of pilots that originate from, have a destination of, or make an intermediate stop at a location outside the contiguous 48 states. A scheduled international flight activity that actually operates entirely within the 48 contiguous states shall be governed by the domestic provisions contained in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C" target="_blank">Section 12.C.</a></p>
<p>b.   Domestic rest limitations may be applied to SIBA and FDA trips operating entirely outside the locations described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D1ci" target="_blank">Section 12.D.1.c.i.</a>, provided that they are scheduled not to exceed domestic block hour and on-duty limitations. Such trips must also meet the following:</p>
<p>i. no duty period is scheduled to exceed 6 block hours or 11 hours on duty; and</p>
<p>ii.    if a duty period actually exceeds 6 block hours or 11 hours on duty, that duty period may be operationally extended as follows:</p>
<p>(a)  to domestic limitations if the preceding rest period was at least a minimum domestic legal rest period; or</p>
<p>(b)  to international limitations if the preceding rest period was at least a minimum international legal rest period; and</p>
<p>iii.   If a duty period actually exceeds 6 block hours or 11 hours on duty, the pilot shall receive an international legal rest period after that duty period.</p>
<p>iv.    A rest period of at least 18 hours after an intercontinental deadhead shall be scheduled prior to the operation of a live flight.</p>
<p>v. An international legal rest period must follow a deadhead to and from a SIBA or FDA base in a trip on which a pilot, other than a pilot on SIBA or FDA, deadheads to and from a SIBA or FDA base to perform flying described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D1b" target="_blank">Section 12.D.1.b.</a> (i.e., the pilot is not assigned to the SIBA or FDA location, but is assigned to fly a trip at such a location).</p>
<p>c.   Unless otherwise agreed by the Association SIG Chairman, trips in the following categories shall be scheduled and operated in accordance with domestic parameters rather than international parameters:</p>
<p>i. Trips that operate entirely within Alaska; or within or between Canada, Mexico, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico, or between any of these locations and the contiguous 48 states.</p>
<p>ii.   For FDA pilots, trips operated exclusively within the “European theater.” For purposes of this provision, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D1cii" target="_blank">Section 12.D.1.c.ii.</a>, the “European theater” includes airports west of 40 degrees east longitude, north of 30 degrees north latitude and east of 10 degrees west longitude.</p>
<p>(a)    If a non FDA pilot deadheads to and from an FDA to perform flying described in this paragraph, an international legal rest period shall follow each of these deadheads, but in any case a rest period of at least 18 hours after an intercontinental deadhead shall be scheduled prior to the operation of a live flight. The non FDA pilot shall otherwise be subject to domestic parameters.</p>
<p>(b)    If the Company revises a trip that, prior to the revision, was scheduled exclusively within the “European theater,” and due to the revision includes activity outside the European theater, the remainder of the trip shall be subject to international parameters.</p>
<p>iii.   If the Company opens a new FDA to operate trips that are not in the European theater, the parties shall meet and discuss whether trips assigned to that base should be eligible for construction under Section <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D1c" target="_blank">12.D.1.c.</a> If the Company and the Association agree, trips in that new FDA may be constructed under <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D1c" target="_blank">Section 12.D.1.c.</a></p>
<p>d.   International Duty Free Buffer</p>
<p>i. A pilot shall be relieved of all duty for at least 24 consecutive hours prior to the start of an international trip scheduled to exceed 120 consecutive hours. A pilot may, however, be on reserve (during which time he performed no flying or standby duty) within 24 hours of the showtime for an international trip scheduled to exceed 120 consecutive hours.</p>
<p>ii.    A pilot shall be relieved of all duty and reserve availability for at least 48 consecutive hours at the conclusion of an international trip that exceeds 120 hours TAFB, except for trips scheduled in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D1ci" target="_blank">Section 12.D.1.c.i.</a> If the 48 hour buffer conflicts with an R-24 pilot’s notification window, he shall be responsible for reserve assignments placed in VIPS at least 24 hours prior to the scheduled showtime of the assignment (as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25M3avb" target="_blank">Section 25.M.3.a.v.(b)</a>).</p>
<p>iii.   A pilot may waive the international buffers set forth in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D1di" target="_blank">Section 12.D.1.d.i.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D1dii" target="_blank">ii.</a> A pilot is deemed to have waived any conflict with the international buffer resulting from a bid line adjustment, reassignment trip, or a volunteer or draft assignment.</p>
<p>e.   International Emergency Replacement</p>
<p>If it is necessary to position a pilot to a location outside the contiguous 48 states, to replace another pilot who cannot complete his trip, the positioning pilot’s duty period may be extended as necessary, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p>i. no field emergency pilot is available; and</p>
<p>ii.    operational requirements prevent the positioning pilot from being scheduled in compliance with normal scheduling parameters (i.e., <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D5" target="_blank">Section 12.D.5.</a>); and</p>
<p>iii.   the duty time extension must be authorized by the System Chief Pilot or his designee; and</p>
<p>iv.    the class of service for a deadhead scheduled for less than 16 hours on duty shall comply with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_8A5ci" target="_blank">Section 8.A.5.c.i.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_8A5cii" target="_blank">ii.</a> The class of service for a deadhead scheduled to exceed 16 hours on duty shall comply with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_8A5civb" target="_blank">Section 8.A.5.c.iv.(b)</a>. A lower class of service may be authorized by the Vice President, Flight Operations, or his designee. In any case, the pilot’s deviation bank shall be credited as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_8A5cvi" target="_blank">Section 8.A.5.c.vi.</a> (highest available class); and</p>
<p>v. the pilot shall receive an international legal rest period following the deadhead.</p>
<p>vi.    If a pilot’s duty period is extended under the provisions of this paragraph, he shall be compensated as follows:</p>
<p>(a)  If the pilot is not a reserve pilot, he shall be compensated trip guarantee at 150% of his normal pay rate.</p>
<p>(b)  If the pilot is a reserve pilot, 100% of the trip guarantee shall be credited toward RLG and leveling, and the remaining 50% shall be compensated in addition to RLG.</p>
<p>f.   A double crew may be scheduled only when the duty period requires such crew, or when the Company anticipates that such crew may be required.</p>
<p>g.    International Alert Calls</p>
<p>i. International alert calls shall be available as follows:</p>
<p>(a)  Upon request, flight crews in domicile will receive an alert call for trip departures to ANC or HNL, and intercontinental destinations (e.g., to Europe, South America, or Asia), but not Canada, Caribbean, or Mexico (Central America) destinations;</p>
<p>(b)  In advance of duty periods whose first revenue flight has an origin and destination outside the contiguous 48 States, regardless of scheduled duty time; and</p>
<p>(c)  Flight crews not in domicile will receive an alert call for trip departures to ANC or HNL, and intercontinental destinations (e.g., to Europe, South America, or Asia), but not Canada, Caribbean, or Mexico (Central America) destinations.</p>
<p>ii.    Procedures for alert calls may vary by location, but in any event shall be provided at least 1 hour prior to scheduled pick-up time.</p>
<p>iii.   Alert calls are provided on the basis that they do not start a pilot’s duty clock; should regulations apply which require a pilot’s duty clock to start when he receives an alert call, there shall no longer be any alert call requirement in force.</p>
<p>h.   The Company shall pursue FAA approval of an enhanced rest environment on B767 aircraft. Any augmented duty periods on B757 or B767 aircraft lacking an enhanced rest environment, shall require an enhanced sleep opportunity (ESO). The ESO shall be required prior to the flight segment if the flight segment departs from a location outside the pilot’s base. The ESO shall be required following the flight segment, unless that flight segment ends at base. The ESO shall consist of a duty free period of at least 36 hours. The ESO may be waived by the pilot operationally.</p>
<p>i.   1-in-7</p>
<p>A pilot shall be relieved from all duty for at least 24 consecutive hours at least once during any seven consecutive days.</p>
<p>2. International Grid</p>
<p>The international grid and its related crew planning limitations shall apply until 96 hours prior to the showtime of an international trip or series of trips, other than those scheduled in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D1b" target="_blank">Section 12.D.1.b.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D1c" target="_blank">c.</a> Trips constructed and revisions that occur after that time shall be governed by <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D3" target="_blank">Section 12.D.3.</a> through D.10.</p>

<p>ii.    if, due to the delay, the pilot is projected to exceed operational limitations, he shall advise CRS, and shall be given a legal rest period, or with mutual consent of the pilot and CRS, the pilot may extend up to the time required to complete the deadhead or until cancellation, whichever occurs first. CRS shall ensure that adequate crew rest is provided at the destination.</p>
<p>c.   If the Company’s operations or flight(s) are disrupted due to extenuating circumstances not within the control of the Company, including, but not limited to, severe weather, natural disasters, ATC limitations or significant system disruptions, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>i. A pilot may, subject to <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D6cii" target="_blank">Section 12.D.6.c.ii.</a>, be scheduled to continue on duty up to 1:30 past operational limits, or 16 hours, whichever is greater, with the prior approval of the Vice President, Flight Operations, or his designee, if necessary to complete his scheduled or rescheduled flight sequence or return to base, whichever occurs first. Block time limitations as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D4" target="_blank">Section 12.D.4.</a> still apply.</p>
<p>ii.    In the event of a trip delay, revision or operational emergency that extends, or would extend, a pilot beyond the operational limitations, a pilot who becomes excessively tired shall notify CRS immediately and then speak to the Duty Officer about his situation. Depending on the pilot’s situation and the Duty Officer’s assessment, one of the following alternatives shall be enlisted to address the issue:</p>
<p>(a)  The pilot’s duty may be revised to include some alternative duty that is at or within operational limits; or</p>
<p>(b)  The pilot may be given a legal rest period. In this case, the pilot’s schedule thereafter may be postponed until after the legal rest period is concluded.</p>
<p>(c)  Should it be determined that the pilot requires more rest than the legal rest provided pursuant to <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D6ciib" target="_blank">Section 12.D.6.c.ii.(b)</a>, the pilot may be removed from the balance of his trip and be placed in sick leave status. If the pilot is placed in sick leave status, the pilot shall be automatically returned from sick leave at the conclusion of his trip.</p>
<p>(d)  The FERC shall meet and discuss all instances to which <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D6cii" target="_blank">Section 12.D.6.c.ii.</a> applied.</p>
<p>iii.   Deadheads that are necessary in any of the situations described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D6cii" target="_blank">Section 12.D.6.c.ii.</a> shall be accomplished in accordance with the Agreement.</p>
<p>iv.    Nothing in these paragraphs shall diminish a pilot’s responsibility to ensure that he has adequate rest prior to reporting for duty.</p>
<p>7. International Rest Provisions</p>
<p>a.   An international legal rest period shall be a minimum of 12 hours.</p>
<p>b.   An international duty period shall be preceded by a duty free period of not less than 12 hours, except for international trips scheduled to domestic parameters (as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D1b" target="_blank">Section 12.D.1.b.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D1c" target="_blank">c.</a>).</p>
<p>c.   If a pilot’s international duty period is scheduled to exceed 8 block hours or 12 hours on-duty, he shall be scheduled for a rest period of at least 17 hours following that duty period. That rest period may be operationally reduced:</p>
<p>i. to a rest period of 16 hours;</p>
<p>ii.    to a minimum of 12 hours if the ABH do not exceed 8 hours and the actual hours on duty do not exceed 12 hours; or</p>
<p>iii.   to a minimum of 12 hours, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D7d" target="_blank">Section 12.D.7.d.</a></p>
<p>d.   If an international flight arrives late at a layover location, the international rest period at that location may be reduced to the extent necessary to protect an on time departure for the next duty period. The international rest period, however, shall not be less than 12 hours plus 1 minute rest for each minute by which the duty period preceding that rest period exceeded the applicable scheduled on duty limitation.</p>
<p>e.   Except for international trips scheduled to domestic parameters (as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D1b" target="_blank">Section 12.D.1.b.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D1c" target="_blank">c.</a>), upon completion of an international duty period and prior to a domestic duty period, a pilot shall receive a minimum international legal rest period unless a greater legal rest period is required.</p>
<p>8. International Double Crew Provisions (Non-ULR)</p>
<p>a.   A double crew for a 2-pilot aircraft shall be:</p>
<p>i. Scheduled: A double crew may be scheduled with 2 Captains and 2 First Officers or with 1 Captain and 3 First Officers, provided, however that for the first 3 bid periods during which a new lane segment is being developed, a double crew flying that lane segment shall consist of 2 Captains and 2 First Officers.</p>
<p>ii.    Operational: 1 Captain and 3 First Officers 2-Pilot Aircraft</p>
<p>b.   A double crew may be utilized only on aircraft equipped with a bunk for each resting pilot that allows for a flat sleeping position and is located separate from the flight deck and in an area that is temperature controlled, allows the flight crew member to control light, and provides isolation from noise and disturbance.</p>
<p>c.   Block Hour Limitations</p>
<p>A 4-pilot double crew shall not exceed 16 block hours in any 24 consecutive hours.</p>
<p>d.   On-duty Limitations</p>
<p>A 4-pilot crew may be scheduled to a maximum of 18 hours on duty, which may be extended to 19:30 hours operational.</p>
<p>e.   Rest Provisions</p>
<p>A double crew shall be scheduled to receive a rest period following each duty period equal to or greater than the actual on-duty hours of that duty period, but not less than 17 hours. This rest requirement may be operationally reduced to 16 hours.</p>
<p>9. Additional Landing and Duty Extension Limitations</p>
<p>The following additional limits apply to trips governed by <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D3" target="_blank">Section 12.D.3.</a> through 8., even in situations covered by <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12A3" target="_blank">Section 12.A.3.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D6ci" target="_blank">12.D.6.c.i.</a></p>
<p>a.   If a landing(s) is added to a trip governed by Section 12.D.3. through 8., such landing(s) shall be limited to one more than those permitted in the International Grid, provided however, that in unusual operational circumstances (e.g., air turn backs, weather/maintenance diverts, unscheduled tech stops, etc.), a pilot shall consult with the Vice President, Flight Operations or his designee, and may, at the pilot’s election, exceed such limits in order to finish his scheduled flight sequence.</p>
<p>b.   Any extension beyond operational limits as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12A3" target="_blank">Section 12.A.3.</a>, or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D6ci" target="_blank">D.6.c.i.</a>, shall be limited to 1:30 past operational limits, or 16 hours, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>10.    Grid Penalties</p>
<p>This paragraph applies to all international trips except for international trips constructed under <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D1b" target="_blank">Section 12.D.1.b.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D1c" target="_blank">c.</a></p>
<p>a.   A grid penalty event (GPE) occurs in the following six circumstances:</p>
<p>i. A pilot’s duty period exceeds the maximum duty permitted in the Grid based on his Grid sleep state by more than 1:30.</p>
<p>ii.    A pilot’s layover was less than the applicable International Grid Minimum Layover (i.e., 14 hours or 12 based on the chart in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D2e" target="_blank">Section 12.D.2.e.</a>).</p>
<p>iii.    A pilot received more than 4 “not adjusted” rests in a row. Each rest after 3 non-adjusted rests shall be a separate GPE event. An initial GPE occurs when the pilot’s fifth duty period begins without the pilot having received at least 18 hours free from duty preceding the beginning of that duty period. For purposes of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D10aiii" target="_blank">Section 12.D.10.a.iii.</a> (this paragraph) only, an unassigned hotel standby period shall be counted as part of the rest periods preceding and/or following it (e.g., an unassigned 11:30 hotel standby period, followed by a 12:30 rest period will be counted as an adjusted rest).</p>
<p>iv.    A pilot exceeds the landing limitations as permitted in the Grid in any single duty period.</p>
<p>v.    30-in-120 Nonconformance Penalty</p>
<p>If a pilot’s trip did not conform to 30-in-120 (as set forth in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D2g" target="_blank">Section 12.D.2.g.</a>, except using 30 instead of 32 hours), he shall be paid 3 CH in addition to all other compensation regardless of the 48-hour period as stated in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D10c" target="_blank">Section 12.D.10.c.</a>, and the event shall be additive to the total count of GPEs for the trip.</p>
<p>vi.    34-in-168 Nonconformance Penalty</p>
<p>If a pilot’s trip did not conform to 34-in-168 (as set forth in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D2g" target="_blank">Section 12.D.2.g.</a>, except using 34 instead of 36 hours), he shall be paid 3 CH in addition to all other compensation regardless of the 48-hour period as stated in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D10c" target="_blank">Section 12.D.10.c.</a>, and the event shall be additive to the total count of GPEs for the trip.</p>
<p>b.   If all GPEs in a trip touch a single 48 hour period, no grid penalty shall be due, except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D10av" target="_blank">Section 12.D.10.a.v.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D10avi" target="_blank">vi.</a></p>
<p>c.   If all GPEs do not touch a single 48 hour period, then the following penalties shall apply:</p>
<p>i. If the trip has two or fewer GPEs, the pilot shall be paid 3 CH per violation in addition to all other compensation. A duty period that triggers a payment under this paragraph shall be ineligible for FAR Extension Pay.</p>
<p>ii.    If the trip contained more than two GPEs, the pilot’s trip guarantee shall be paid a premium of 50% based on the pilot’s normal rate of pay (i.e., if trip guarantee was at 100%, it pays at 150%; if trip guarantee was at 125% (OTP), it pays at 175%; if trip guarantee was at 150%, it pays at 200%). For a reserve pilot, the CH representing the 50% premium shall not be credited toward RLG, but shall be paid in addition to all other compensation, including BLG/RLG.</p>
<p>iii.    If a trip has multiple GPEs, one of which is a 30-in-120 or 34-in-168 violation, the GPEs in that trip shall be deemed not to touch a single 48 hour period.</p>
<p>11.    In the event that the Company acquires any Airbus A380 aircraft for use in revenue operations, the Company agrees to reinstate and honor all A380-specific language as it appeared in the 2006 and 2011 CBAs.</p>
<p>E.  Ultra Long Range (ULR) Flying</p>
<p>1. A ULR trip is a trip in which at least one revenue flight segment is scheduled to exceed either 16 hours of block or 18 hours of duty.</p>
<p>2. ULR Grid</p>
<p>The ULR Grid is only applicable to ULR flight segments within a trip.</p>

As provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12A10" target="_blank">Section 12.A.10.</a>, ULR operations shall be evaluated as part of the FRMS. In addition to the provisions in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12A10" target="_blank">Section 12.A.10.</a>, following the FRMS study, and with the unanimous approval of the Scientific Advisory Committee, the Company may seek approval by the FAA for ULR city pair flight segments which shall include the specific pairing design as approved by the DCSC. If approved, the specific pairing design shall not be materially altered without the consent of the Association.</p>
<p>4. Other ULR Scheduling Limitations and Provisions</p>
<p>Upon the FAA’s approval of ULR operations under the Company’s FRMS, and notwithstanding <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D8" target="_blank">Section 12.D.8.</a>, all ULR-related provisions contained in this Agreement shall become immediately applicable for the specific pairing design approved by the FAA.</p>
<p>a.   A ULR crew may be utilized only on aircraft equipped with a bunk for each resting pilot that allows for a flat sleeping position and is located separate from the flight deck and in an area that is temperature controlled, allows the flight crew member to control light, and provides isolation from noise and disturbance.</p>
<p>b.   Block Hour Limitations</p>
<p>A ULR crew shall not exceed 18 block hours in any 24 consecutive hours.</p>
<p>c.   On-Duty Limitations</p>
<p>A ULR crew may be scheduled to a maximum of 20 hours on duty, which may be extended to 21:30 hours operational. Any extension beyond the operational limit up to legal limits shall include the protections contained in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D6c" target="_blank">Section 12.D.6.c.</a></p>
<p>d.   Rest Provisions</p>
<p>A ULR crew shall be scheduled to receive a rest period of 40 hours or greater, prior to and after a ULR flight segment. This rest period may be operationally reduced to 38 hours. However, if the ULR flight segment is scheduled to depart within (+/-) 1 time zone of the pilot’s base, and the flight sequence prior to the ULR flight contains no more than a single flight segment, the scheduled rest period required prior to the ULR flight segment shall be 24 hours, which may be operationally reduced to 18 hours.</p>
<p>e.   There shall be no more than 2 scheduled ULR flight segments per trip, except on an operational basis with the pilot’s consent.</p>
<p>f.   A ULR double crew shall be scheduled with a minimum of 2 Captains but, operationally, may consist of 1 Captain and 3 First Officers.</p>
<p>g.   Upon a return to base from a trip greater than 168 hours TAFB which concludes with a ULR flight segment, a ULR crew shall receive a 56 hour period free from duty, encompassing 3 Physiological Nights Rest (0100-0700 LBT).</p>
<p>h.   The parties recognize that the matters governed by <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12E" target="_blank">Section 12.E.</a> are new to the system and involve as yet unforeseen operational considerations. As a result, the parties foresee that flexibility will be required in order to ensure the smoothest possible transition to the application of ULR rules. To that end, measures facilitating the implementation, operation, and/or administration of the provisions in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12E" target="_blank">Section 12.E.</a> may be implemented if agreed upon in writing by the Vice President, Labor Relations and the Association’s MEC Chairman.</p>

<h1 class="persist-header">Section 13: Leaves of Absence</h1>
<p>A.   General</p>
<p>1. A pilot’s filing for a leave of absence shall be directed to his Fleet Captain. The filing shall be submitted as far in advance as practicable prior to the intended start of the leave filed for, except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_13B1" target="_blank">Section 13.B.1.</a> (Personal Leave of Absence). The filing shall contain a statement of the type of leave and the reason(s) for which the leave of absence is being filed for, except that reasons for a Medical Leave of Absence shall be sent to the Company’s aeromedical advisor, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_13C" target="_blank">Section 13.C.</a> The pilot’s Fleet Captain, or his designee, shall respond in writing to a filing for a leave of absence as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 calendar days following receipt of the filing.</p>
<p>2. A pilot returning from a leave of absence is expected to possess FAA certificates and ratings consistent with the crew status to which the pilot is returning, as provided in Section <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24A3a" target="_blank">24.A.3.a.</a></p>
<p>3. A pilot returning from a leave of absence, other than a medical leave of absence, who does not possess an FAA medical certificate, shall be placed on sick leave or Medical Leave of Absence, provided the pilot is otherwise eligible for that leave as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_13C" target="_blank">Section 13.C.</a> (including verification of his medical condition by the Company’s aeromedical advisor if required by the Company).</p>
<p>4. Rules of conduct applicable to pilots in active service apply to pilots on leaves of absence. The standard for administering discipline and discharge for a pilot on a leave of absence shall be as provided in Section 19.

<p>5. A pilot on a leave of absence shall not engage in other flying employment without prior written permission from the System Chief Pilot, or his designee.</p>
<p>6. The following provisions shall apply to a pilot capable of returning to active service following a leave of absence.</p>
<p>a.   A pilot on leave of absence in excess of a full bid period shall contact his Fleet Captain to notify him of the return date to active service; and his Fleet Captain shall aid the pilot in coordinating such return.</p>
<p>i. The contact shall occur at least 30 days prior to the anticipated end of his leave of absence. The Fleet Captain shall confirm, in writing if requested, the return date and resumption to active pay status, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_13A6aii" target="_blank">Section 13.A.6.a.ii.</a></p>
<p>ii.    Provided that a pilot has complied with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_13A6ai" target="_blank">Section 13.A.6.a.i.</a>, the pilot shall be returned to active pay status upon his return. Failure to comply with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_13A6ai" target="_blank">Section 13.A.6.a.i.</a> may result in the pilot’s return to active pay status being delayed an amount equal to the notification delay. In no case shall the pilot be returned to active pay status later than 30 days following the pilot’s return date.</p>
<p>b.   A pilot’s crew position upon return to duty following a leave of absence shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p>i. If no System Bids closed during his absence, the pilot shall return to the crew position that was the pilot’s then currently awarded/assigned crew position immediately prior to the commencement of the leave of absence; or</p>
<p>ii.    If any System Bids closed during his absence, he shall select from among those crew positions that:</p>
<p>(a)  he could have been awarded/assigned, but for his absence, on any of the System Bids that closed during his absence; and</p>
<p>(b)  in which, upon his return to active status, he would not be the junior awarded/assigned pilot in that crew position.</p>
<p>c.   If upon returning to active status from a leave of absence, the pilot’s current crew position does not differ from the pilot’s currently awarded/assigned crew position, and requalification training is required, requalification training for the pilot’s current crew position shall start within 60 days of his return date, if either:</p>
<p>i. No System Bid closed during his absence; or</p>
<p>ii.    A System Bid closed during his absence, but he did not (or could not) select a new crew position (as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_13A6bii" target="_blank">Section 13.A.6.b.ii.</a>).</p>
<p>d.   If upon returning to active status from a leave of absence, the pilot’s current crew position differs from the pilot’s currently awarded/assigned crew position, the pilot’s training shall be handled in the same manner as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_13A6e" target="_blank">Section 13.A.6.e.</a></p>
<p>e.   If the pilot selects a new crew position (as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_13A6bii" target="_blank">Section 13.A.6.b.ii.</a> above), training for that crew position shall be as follows:</p>
<p>i. If the System Bid on which the pilot was awarded/assigned his selected crew position has been trained to completion, the pilot shall be assigned to start training within 60 days of his return.</p>
<p>ii.    If the System Bid on which the pilot was awarded/assigned his selected crew position has not been trained to completion and if he requires full requalification training (i.e., training with a footprint similar to ITU) in his current crew position upon his return, the pilot shall be assigned to start training for his selected crew position within 60 days of his return.</p>
<p>iii.   If the System Bid on which the pilot was awarded/assigned his selected crew position has not been trained to completion and if the pilot requires 24-Requal training in his current crew position upon his return:</p>
<p>(a)  the pilot will be assigned to start training for his selected crew position within 60 days of his return if a junior pilot in the case of a crew position award (or a senior pilot in the case of a crew position assignment) has been awarded/assigned a training date; or</p>
<p>(b)  the pilot will be assigned to start 24-Requal training within 60 days of his return if a junior pilot in the case of a crew position award (or a senior pilot in the case of a crew position assignment) has not been awarded/assigned a training date.

His BTA shall be effective on the first day of the first full bid period following the completion of requalification training.</p>
<p>If the pilot’s selected crew position requires a BTA but the pilot does not require requalification training in his current crew position, his BTA shall be effective on the first day of the first full bid period following his return.</p>

A pilot using vacation for an entire bid period may elect to take vacation in whole hour increments from 36 CH up to and including her BLG/RLG. That election may be changed from bid period to bid period and must be submitted in writing (email is acceptable) to the pilot’s Fleet Captain, or his designee, within 48 hours following the close of bidding for the bid period to which the election pertains. In the absence of an election, the pilot shall be compensated at the BLG/RLG of her awarded line (if supported by her vacation bank).</p>
<p>b.   Sick Leave</p>
<p>A pilot shall be deemed automatically eligible to use sick leave within the Maternity Period from the beginning of the 21st week of pregnancy through 30 days from the end of the pregnancy, provided that the pilot provides her Fleet Captain, or his designee, or at her election the Company’s aeromedical advisor, with a medical certification of pregnancy and of the beginning of the 21st week of pregnancy or a medical certification of childbirth, as applicable.</p>

<!-- SECTION 14 -->
<div class="four" id="section14">
<h1 class="persist-header">Section 14: Sick Leave</h1>
<p>A.   General</p>
<p>1. The purpose of sick leave is to protect a pilot from loss of pay, to the extent of his sick leave accrual, when the pilot is unable to perform his assigned duties because of injury, physical or mental illness, or trip fatigue as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12A9" target="_blank">Section 12.A.9.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C5bii" target="_blank">Section 12.C.5.b.ii.</a>, and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D6c" target="_blank">Section 12.D.6.c.</a></p>
<p>2. A pilot may review his regular and disability sick account balances in VIPS or other Company computer systems. A pilot shall continue to accrue seniority and longevity while on sick leave.</p>
<p>3. A furloughed pilot shall retain his regular and disability sick accounts as follows:</p>
<p>a.   If a pilot is on furlough on the last day of the calendar year, the balance of his regular sick account, if any, shall be transferred to his disability sick account or to the surplus program, as applicable in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_14D" target="_blank">Section 14.D.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_14E" target="_blank">14.E.</a></p>
<p>b.   If a pilot recalled from furlough was not in an active pay status on the first day of the calendar year, he shall be credited with a pro rata portion of his annual sick leave accrual.</p>
<p>4. If, having exhausted his occupational injury/illness leave, a pilot receives workers’ compensation payments and sick leave pay at the same time, he may use only enough sick leave so that the workers’ compensation payments plus the sick leave pay equals 100 percent of his BLG/RLG.</p>
<p>5. A pilot who has been removed from a scheduled event and placed on sick leave shall not perform any flight duty during the time that the original event was scheduled to take place, except as follows:</p>
<p>a.   by calling CRS directly, the pilot may elect to be placed back on his original event if it has not been reassigned at the time of his “well call”; or</p>
<p>b.   after calling in “well,” in VIPS, the pilot may elect to submit for a different event as MUS, if that event has a showtime:</p>
<p>i. outside the footprint of the original event; or</p>
<p>ii.    at least 48 hours after the showtime of the original event.</p>
<p>6. The Company may require a pilot to provide the System Chief Pilot’s designee with a written statement from the pilot’s physician explaining his inability to perform his assigned duties because of illness or injury if:</p>
<p>a.   The Company has a good faith, and objective reason to question a pilot’s use or attempted use of sick leave; or</p>
<p>b.   The pilot’s absence from duty occurred within 24 hours of the beginning or end of the pilot’s vacation period or a “holiday.” As used herein, “holiday” means Easter, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, Christmas, New Year’s Eve or New Year’s Day. For purposes of this provision, the “vacation period” is the period originally awarded, unless the period is slid and/or extended, in which case the slid and/or extended dates become the “vacation period.”</p>
<p>c.   The pilot has requested to utilize his disability sick account in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_14D2a" target="_blank">Section 14.D.2.a.</a></p>
<p>7. A pilot may elect to use vacation CH to delay or avoid going on disability. Failure to exercise this election is a factor that may result in forfeiture of CH from his vacation bank pursuant to <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7G6" target="_blank">Section 7.G.6.</a> (40% limitation on vacation buy back).</p>
<p>B.   Use of Sick Leave</p>
<p>1. If a pilot has no credit in his regular or disability sick accounts, and would otherwise be in sick leave status, he shall be removed from his trips while he is sick and placed on medical leave of absence (without pay). If a pilot has an injury/illness that qualifies for LTD, he will receive disability benefits in accordance with Section 27.</p>
<p>2. Illness or Injury Notification Requirements</p>
<p>A pilot who becomes ill or injured shall promptly notify the Company via VIPS of his unavailability for assigned duties.</p>
<p>a.   After notification of his illness or injury a pilot shall be placed on sick leave.</p>
<p>b.   Pilots Not on Reserve</p>
<p>i. At 0700 LBT each day, any trip with 120 hours TAFB or more, with a showtime during the next two local base days that is assigned to a pilot who is on sick leave shall be available in open time for Bid Line Adjustments as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25L" target="_blank">Section 25.L.</a> At 1000 LBT, such trips shall become available for assignment by CRS.</p>
<p>ii.

<p>c.   Reserve Pilots</p>
<p>The following shall apply to a reserve pilot who calls in sick for an R-day(s) or a reserve assignment:</p>
<p>i. A pilot holding a line comprised entirely of R-days or holding a mini-RLG consisting of a block(s) of R-days and who is sick for all such R-days shall be compensated his RLG/mini-RLG and shall have his sick leave reduced by such RLG/mini-RLG.</p>
<p>ii.    A reserve pilot who has been given a reserve assignment(s) prior to calling in sick shall be removed from that assignment(s) commencing at 0900 LBT on the day prior to showtime for that assignment(s) or at the time of the sick call, whichever is later.</p>
<p>iii.   A reserve pilot on sick leave shall be assigned open time as if he were not on sick leave (<a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25G3" target="_blank">Section 25.G.3.</a> Open Time Assignment and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25M6" target="_blank">Section 25.M.6.</a> Reserve Assignment Options). A reserve pilot will maintain his leveling position on the reserve list, and the scheduled credit hours for any trips he is assigned and removed as sick will be credited toward his RLG/mini-RLG and deducted from his sick bank. Commencing at 0900 LBT each day, a reserve pilot with an assignment(s) having a showtime during the next day shall be removed for sick leave and such assignment shall be available for open time assignment by CRS.</p>
<p>3. Well Call</p>
<p>A pilot who is no longer ill or injured shall promptly notify the Company via VIPS, consistent with other provisions of this Agreement (e.g., medical clearance if required, Section 15 process if applicable). Except as provided by <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12A9" target="_blank">Section 12.A.9.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C5bii" target="_blank">Section 12.C.5.b.ii.</a>, and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D6c" target="_blank">Section 12.D.6.c.</a>, a pilot shall remain in sick leave status until he notifies the Company via VIPS of his ability to return to flight status and, if applicable, is released by the Company aeromedical advisor to return to duty. If the pilot so elects, in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_14A5a" target="_blank">Section 14.A.5.a.</a>, then he shall be given his original assignment(s) if it has not been reassigned to another pilot.</p>
<p>4. Ill or Injured During a Trip</p>
<p>A pilot who becomes ill or injured away from base during a trip shall earn trip guarantee for the entire trip plus actual accumulated overage, if any. He shall be charged sick leave, commencing with the next showtime following his sick call and ending at the showtime for the next duty period he operates during that trip, if any, for the remaining value of his trip. A pilot who becomes ill or injured while away from his base on Company duty shall be provided with proper medical attention, including hospitalization, when required. The Company shall provide transportation, when the pilot is able to travel, back to his base, or at the pilot’s option, to his residence provided that the travel cost is limited to the travel cost of returning to base. A pilot whose placement on sick leave causes him to return to base later than scheduled shall not accrue additional CH for that late return.</p>
<p>5. Sick Leave Pay and Account Deductions</p>
<p>If a pilot is removed from an assigned activity due to sick leave, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>a.   Pilots Not On Reserve (who hold trip guarantee)</p>
<p>If a pilot is removed from a trip, or portion thereof, for which he holds trip guarantee, he shall be compensated, and his sick leave account(s) shall be reduced by the scheduled credit hours for that trip.</p>

<p>ii.    The CH value of an assignment (or portion thereof) shall not be charged to sick leave if it would cause the pilot to exceed RLG.</p>
<p>iii.   Upon his return to flight status, a reserve pilot may be given an assignment(s) for which he is eligible provided that assignment does not begin prior to the scheduled termination of the last activity charged to sick leave. No legality conflict shall be considered to take place between the last reserve trip charged to sick leave and a subsequent assignment.</p>
<p>c.   If a pilot assigned as MUS, MUV, CMU, VLT or DRF is removed from a trip prior to block-out due to sick leave, he shall not earn any credit hours for that trip and no deduction shall be made from his sick leave account.</p>
<p>d.   If a pilot assigned a reassignment trip (RAT) is removed from a trip prior to block-out due to sick leave, he shall be compensated the trip guarantee of the reassignment trip at 100% of his normal pay rate and his sick leave bank shall be charged accordingly.</p>
<p>e.   If a pilot assigned a PDO trip is unable to operate that trip due to illness or injury, the scheeduled trip guarantee shall be deducted from his sick leave account.</p>
<p>f.

<p>g.   If a pilot, having commenced initial, transition or upgrade training, is unable to attend that training due to sick leave, he shall be compensated as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4I5" target="_blank">Section 4.I.5.</a>, and his sick leave account(s) shall be reduced by 3 CH for each day sick on a scheduled event, not to exceed his BLG/RLG.</p>

<p>i. If a pilot eligible for substitution is placed on sick leave, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>i. If he is removed from a substitution trip(s), the SCH for that trip shall be credited toward his original trip guarantee and deducted from his sick leave account.</p>

<p>6. Illness or Injury for Entire Bid Period</p>
<p>A pilot who has been on sick leave for at least 30 days prior to the monthly bid closing and/or is expected to be on sick leave for the entire bid period shall bid pay only unless his Fleet Captain authorizes him to bid a line for flying purposes. However, a pilot who, at the time of bid closing, is activated but is not qualified in his assigned crew position shall be handled in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25C6" target="_blank">Section 25.C.6.</a> Unless such pilot is assigned a custom line as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25I" target="_blank">Section 25.I.</a>, he shall be compensated the BLG or RLG of his pay only line and his sick leave account(s) shall be reduced by the same amount.

<p>3. During the calendar year in which a pilot is hired, he shall be credited with 6 CH for each bid period remaining in such calendar year, subject to <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_14C5" target="_blank">Section 14.C.5.</a></p>
<p>4. If a pilot is placed in an inactive pay status following the first day of the first bid period of a calendar year, his regular sick account shall be reduced by 6 CH for each bid period during which he is in an unpaid status during the remainder of the calendar year. If the balance in his regular sick account is insufficient to make the adjustment, then the adjustment shall be made from the pilot’s disability sick account. This adjustment shall occur before the pilot’s regular sick account balance is converted and credited to his disability sick account or surplus program, as applicable.</p>
<p>5. If a pilot is in an active pay status for less than one half of a bid period, that bid period shall not count for purposes of sick leave accrual.</p>
<p>6. Administration</p>
<p>a.   A pilot removed from an activity due to sick leave shall have the credit for that activity(ies) charged against his regular sick account. However, a pilot may elect to have that sick leave charged to his disability sick account provided he complies with the requirements of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_14D2" target="_blank">Section 14.D.2.</a></p>
<p>b.   At the end of the last bid period of each calendar year, any hours remaining in a pilot’s regular sick account shall be transferred to his disability sick account, subject to the disability sick account ceiling (as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_14D1" target="_blank">Section 14.D.1.</a>). Any sick leave credits in excess of the disability sick account ceiling shall be transferred to the surplus program provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_14E" target="_blank">Section 14.E.</a></p>
<p>7. Make-Up Sick (MUS)</p>
<p>A pilot is eligible to make up CH drawn from his regular sick account. No more than 72 CH per calendar year may be earned in MUS status to replace hours drawn from his regular sick account.</p>
<p>D.   Disability Sick Account</p>
<p>1. The disability sick account ceiling shall be 686 CH.</p>
<p>2. Administration</p>
<p>a.   A pilot who wishes to utilize his disability sick account shall notify his Fleet Captain of the nature of his illness or injury and, if requested, provide medical documentation. A pilot may utilize his disability sick account under any of the following conditions:</p>
<p>i. The pilot’s application for a medical certificate has been denied or the pilot has been advised by an aviation medical examiner or the Company’s Aeromedical advisor that he is or may not be entitled to exercise the privileges of his medical certificate; or</p>
<p>ii.    The pilot has sustained an illness or injury that is anticipated to result in the pilot’s missing more than 36 CH; or</p>
<p>iii.   The pilot has exhausted his regular sick account.</p>
<p>b.   A pilot on sick leave for a full bid period or longer may elect to receive sick leave in whole hour increments from 36 CH up to and including his BLG/RLG. That election may be changed from bid period to bid period and must be submitted in writing (e-mail is acceptable) to the System Chief Pilot’s designee within 48 hours following the close of bidding for the bid period to which the election pertains. In the absence of an election, the pilot shall be compensated the BLG/RLG of his awarded line.</p>
<p>3. Make-Up Sick—Disability</p>
<p>A pilot is eligible to make up CH drawn from his disability sick account as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_14D2a" target="_blank">Section 14.D.2.a.</a></p>
<p>E.   Surplus Program</p>
<p>As provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_14C6b" target="_blank">Section 14.C.6.b.</a>, the number of hours remaining in each pilot’s regular sick account shall be added to the existing balance in that pilot’s disability sick account subject to the account ceiling. If the addition of these hours would cause the balance of the pilot’s disability sick account to exceed the disability sick account ceiling, the value of the excess hours shall be deposited into the pilot’s Employer Contribution Unused Sick Leave Account within the Federal Express Corporation Profit Sharing Plan. The amount of the deposit shall be determined by multiplying the excess CH by the pilot’s pay rate at the end of the calendar year, or if he is no longer in active employment, by his last pay rate. The deposit shall be made during the first bid period of the following calendar year as provided in Section 28. Pilots who would otherwise have been eligible for a contribution into the pilot’s Employer Contribution Unused Sick Leave Account within the Federal Express Corporation Profit Sharing Plan but for the termination of his employment, including retirement, death or resignation, prior to the close of the calendar year shall have the value of any surplus contributed to the pilot’s Employer Contribution Unused Sick Leave Account.</p>
<p>F.   Occupational Injury/Illness</p>
<p>1. A pilot who sustains a workers’ compensable injury or illness covered by <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#section16" target="_blank">Section 16</a> shall be eligible for up to 168 CH of occupational injury/illness leave for each occupational injury or illness. Occupational injury/illness leave may be used for a recurrence of an occupational injury or illness up to the balance of the 168 CH not used for the original occurrence of the injury or illness. Occupational injury/illness leave is a non-accruable benefit. Sick leave shall not be used for occupational injuries or illnesses until occupational injury/illness is exhausted.</p>
<p>2. A pilot shall notify his Fleet Captain as soon as practical of any occupational injury or illness covered by this paragraph.</p>
<p>3. If a pilot exhausts his occupational injury/illness leave and remains unable to return to his scheduled duty, he may utilize his accrued sick leave as provided in this Section.</p>
<p>4. A pilot shall provide the Company and appropriate State authorities with medical documentation verifying an occupational injury/illness and his fitness to return to duty following the injury or illness.</p>
<p>5. Workers’ compensation received by the pilot for a period of absence during which he also received occupational injury/illness leave shall be reimbursed to the Company. In no case shall additional compensation received from workers’ compensation enable a pilot to receive total compensation greater than 100% of his awarded BLG/RLG.</p>

<!-- SECTION 15 -->
<div class="four" id="section15">
<h1 class="persist-header">Section 15: Medical Standards</h1>
<p>A.   General</p>
<p>1. Pilots shall meet the medical standards and possess a valid medical certificate consistent with the FAA standards including its waiver, limitations, restriction, special issuance and related FAA policies for the class of medical certificate required for the pilot’s crew seat.</p>
<p>2. Each pilot shall validate, through VIPS, the issuance of his new medical certificate not later than the earlier of the following:</p>
<p>a.   48 hours prior to the end of his due month; or</p>
<p>b.   0900 LBT the day prior to the start of any trip(s) scheduled to terminate either:</p>
<p>i. after the expiration of the pilot’s medical certificate; or</p>
<p>ii.    within 48 hours of the expiration.</p>
<p>3. While a VIPS notification(s) of a pilot’s pending FAA medical certificate expiration is provided to each pilot, it is the pilot’s responsibility to know and meet the medical standards by possessing a valid FAA medical certificate. Failure of a pilot to receive a VIPS notice shall not excuse the pilot’s failure to maintain his/her valid FAA medical certificate. If a pilot fails to provide the Company with confirmation via VIPS that he has a valid medical certificate as required by this paragraph, before 0900 LBT on the day prior to the showtime of a trip or R-day scheduled to start within the time period as stated in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_15A2" target="_blank">Section 15.A.2.</a>, the trip or R-day shall be removed without pay, and the pilot shall not be eligible for make-up. Trip(s) or R-day(s) shall no longer be removed after the pilot provides the Company with the required validation.</p>
<p>B.   Company Payment of FAA Medical Exam Expenses</p>
<p>1. The Company shall cover an active pilot’s cost of annual or semiannual FAA medical examinations including the cost of a required EKG, up to an annual maximum of $300. The pilot shall use the Company issued travel card if accepted by the provider. If the provider does not accept the Company issued credit card, the pilot must comply with normal non-travel reimbursement procedures that require an itemized list of the services performed by the FAA physician (i.e., FAA physical, EKG if any, physician’s office, date, charge).</p>
<p>2. If an active pilot (or an inactive pilot receiving LTD benefits) incurs medical expenses in order to qualify for an FAA medical certificate, which are not covered by <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_15B1" target="_blank">Section 15.B.1.</a>, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>a.   If submitted within 90 days after having incurred the expense, the Company shall reimburse such pilot for the non-routine medical expenses if:</p>
<p>i. the expenses were incurred at the direction of either:</p>
<p>(a)  the FAA; or</p>
<p>(b)  an FAA designated Aviation Medical Examiner (AME) who reasonably concluded that, in light of FAA requirements, it was necessary to perform a non-routine medical procedure in order for the pilot to obtain or maintain his FAA medical certificate; or</p>
<p>ii.    the expenses were incurred in order to obtain a special issuance FAA medical certificate, as required by the FAA.</p>
<p>b.   A pilot who incurs medical expenses covered by <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_15B2" target="_blank">Section 15.B.2.</a> shall submit or cause to have submitted a medical insurance claim for any such expenses that are covered by insurance. The pilot shall provide a copy of any response(s) to the medical insurance claim to his Fleet Captain within a reasonable time after receiving same. The pilot shall remit to the Company the amount of any insurance claim that was both paid by the Company and reimbursed by the insurance plan. The primary purpose of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_15B2b" target="_blank">Section 15.B.2.b.</a> is to allow any group health insurance discount to be recognized for medical charges that arise out of this section and to avoid any double payment being made for the same service. If a pilot gets reimbursed from both the Company and the service is also covered and paid through the group health plan, the pilot may receive a reimbursement from the health care provider for an overpayment that actually belongs to the Company. In this case, a pilot should remit or cause to have remitted the extra monies paid back to the Company.</p>
<p>C.   Alcohol and Drug Testing</p>
<p>The Company may test pilots for drugs and alcohol only in accordance with the following:</p>
<p>1. The Company shall maintain the drug and alcohol testing programs that are in use on the effective date of this Agreement, as long as such testing is mandated by law or regulation. The term “programs” includes the type of specimen collected, substances for which a pilot is tested, the methods of testing and the thresholds at which testing is conducted.</p>
<p>a.   If any change in a testing program is mandated by law or regulation and the law or regulation does not afford multiple options of compliance, the Company shall give the Association notice and shall consult with the Association at a mutually agreeable time and location concerning such change.</p>
<p>b.   If a law or regulation mandates that a testing program be changed, but affords multiple options by which compliance can be achieved, then the Company and the Association shall meet to discuss the available alternatives. The initial meeting shall commence no later than 60 days following the date the final rule regarding the alternative methods is published in the Federal Register. Should the parties be unable to mutually agree on an alternative testing method within 60 days, then each side may elect to advocate an alternative before a mutually selected arbitrator from the non-disciplinary panel. The parties’ presentations shall be in writing unless either party elects an in-person hearing. The arbitrator shall select the method of testing from the two alternatives presented. If the Company is required to implement a change prior to the conclusion of the process described in this paragraph, nothing in this paragraph shall prevent it from doing so (subject to change depending on the outcome of the <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_15C1b" target="_blank">Section 15.C.1.b.</a> process).</p>
<p>c.   The Company may implement a non-mandatory change in a testing program only with the written consent of the Association.</p>
<p>2. The Company shall maintain the FedEx Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation and Recertification Plan for Flight Crewmembers (HIMS program) that complies with FAA directives regarding pilots who require an Authorization for Special Issuance of a Medical Certificate. Such Plan shall continue to contain full Company participation (including monitoring) in rehabilitating, and returning to work, those pilots who need professional treatment, along with insurance coverage for medical and associated bills in accordance with the terms of those plans as provided in Section 27. Such Plan shall continue to contain payment by the Company of the initial evaluation and the associated psychiatric/psychological evaluation required in conjunction with the petition for a Special Issuance Medical Certificate as provided in Appendix H of the FOM.</p>
<p>3. If the Company has a reasonable basis to believe that a pilot’s ability to perform his duties is impaired for reasons relating to substances not covered by the legally mandated drug testing programs referred to above, the pilot’s case shall be handled as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_15D" target="_blank">Section 15.D.</a></p>
<p>D.   Company Mandated Medical Examinations</p>
<p>1. The VP of Flight Operations, the System Chief Pilot, the Assistant System Chief Pilot, or a Fleet Captain may direct a pilot to contact or see the Company’s aeromedical advisor if the Company has a reasonable basis to question whether a pilot has developed or recovered from an impairment to his ability to perform his duties as a pilot.</p>
<p>2. A pilot in an active pay status who is directed to contact or see the Company’s aeromedical advisor, shall be removed from any conflicting scheduled activities with pay until the aeromedical advisor determines whether the pilot is fit for flight duty.</p>
<p>3. After the Company’s aeromedical advisor consults and/or meets with the pilot, by written notice, he may require the pilot to undergo a test(s), medical examination(s), and/or an evaluation(s) by the advisor or a physician designated by the aeromedical advisor. Upon the pilot’s request, the aeromedical advisor shall consult with the pilot to review and discuss the aeromedical advisor’s rationale for his concerns and the necessity of the prescribed examinations/evaluations.</p>
<p>4. The Company shall pay for all examinations, tests or evaluations performed or directed by its aeromedical advisor. If the pilot needs to travel from the pilot’s permanent, primary address in connection with a Company directed examination(s), test(s) and/or evaluation(s) pursuant to this paragraph, the Company shall provide and arrange transportation, lodging and per diem as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#section5" target="_blank">Section 5</a>.</p>
<p>5. Following the Company’s aeromedical advisor’s review of the results of the examination(s), test(s) and/or evaluation(s), a determination and written notice of same shall be sent to the pilot. The notice shall state the specific grounds for the determination. The determination shall be made in accordance with the following:</p>
<p>a.   If the Company’s aeromedical advisor finds the pilot fit for duty, and the pilot agrees, the pilot shall remain on or return to active flight status without loss of pay.</p>
<p>b.   If the Company’s aeromedical advisor finds the pilot not fit for duty, and the pilot agrees, he shall be placed on sick leave, disability or medical leave of absence, as applicable.</p>
<p>c.   If the Company’s aeromedical advisor finds the pilot fit for duty, and the pilot disagrees, then:</p>
<p>i. if the pilot supplies the Company’s aeromedical advisor with medical documentation substantiating his disagreement, he shall be placed or remain on sick leave, disability or medical leave of absence, as applicable. He shall remain in that status until his case is resolved as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_15D7" target="_blank">Section 15.D.7.</a></p>
<p>ii.    if the pilot does not supply medical documentation supporting his disagreement within 30 days from receipt of the Company’s aeromedical advisor’s determination, he shall be placed on personal leave of absence. If warranted by extenuating circumstances, the System Chief Pilot shall extend the 30 day period. If the pilot subsequently supplies the required documentation, his status shall be determined pursuant to <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_15D5ci" target="_blank">Section 15.D.5.c.i.</a></p>
<p>d.   If the Company’s aeromedical advisor finds the pilot not fit for duty and the pilot disagrees, the pilot shall be placed or remain on sick leave, disability or medical leave of absence, as applicable, until the Company’s aeromedical advisor determines the pilot to be fit for duty, or his case is resolved as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_15D7" target="_blank">Section 15.D.7.</a></p>
<p>6. The Company shall give written notice to ALPA that the Company’s aeromedical advisor has issued a direction to a pilot under <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_15D3" target="_blank">Section 15.D.3.</a> or that the Company’s aeromedical advisor has issued a determination to a pilot under <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_15D5" target="_blank">Section 15.D.5.</a> Such notice shall occur as close in time to the Company’s aeromedical advisor’s notice to the pilot as is reasonably practical under the circumstances.</p>
<p>7. If the pilot disagrees with the Company’s aeromedical advisor, the pilot shall engage, at his expense, a second physician to evaluate his medical condition. Unless otherwise agreed to on a case-by-case basis, the second physician shall be a physician designated as the Association’s Aeromedical Advisor or a physician qualified to diagnose and treat the pilot’s underlying medical condition. If the pilot fails to provide the second physician’s evaluation within 30 days following the Company’s aeromedical advisor’s determination, the pilot may remain on sick, disability or medical leave or be placed on personal leave of absence, as applicable, until he provides the second physician’s evaluation to the Company’s aeromedical advisor. If warranted by extenuating circumstances, the System Chief Pilot shall extend the 30 day period.</p>
<p>a.   If the second physician agrees with the opinion of the Company’s aeromedical advisor, the pilot shall return to active flying status or remain or be placed on sick leave, disability or medical leave of absence consistent with the Company’s aeromedical advisor’s findings.</p>
<p>b.   If the second physician disagrees with the opinion of the Company’s aeromedical advisor, a Medical Review Panel (hereinafter MRP) shall be convened to decide whether the pilot, in their opinion, meets the standards for holding and exercising the privileges of the pilot’s medical certificate. Pending the MRP’s determination, the pilot shall be placed or remain on sick leave, disability or medical leave of absence, as applicable.</p>
<p>i. An MRP shall be composed of the Company’s aeromedical advisor, the physician engaged by the pilot as provided in this paragraph, and a third physician qualified to determine the medical issue in question. The third physician shall be selected by agreement between the Company’s aeromedical advisor and the pilot’s physician.</p>
<p>ii.    As soon as practicable, the MRP shall consult and determine whether the pilot, in their opinion, meets the standards for holding or exercising the privileges of the pilot’s medical certificate.</p>
<p>(a)  Questions regarding the pilot’s medical condition shall be resolved based on the MRP’s determination. The pilot shall remain on or return to active flight status, sick leave, disability or medical leave of absence consistent with the MRP’s determination as applicable.</p>
<p>(b)  If the MRP rules that a pilot is fit for duty and the pilot still disagrees, the pilot shall be placed on personal leave of absence.</p>
<p>(c)  If the MRP’s determination disagrees with the opinion of the Company’s aeromedical advisor, then:</p>
<p>(1)    the Company shall make adjustments, including retroactive adjustments (e.g., back pay or restoration of sick leave), if applicable, that are necessary to make the pilot whole consistent with the MRP’s determination; and</p>
<p>(2)    the Company shall reimburse the pilot for all reasonable costs and expenses he incurred in connection with the determination of his medical condition pursuant to Section 15.D.7. (this paragraph).</p>
<p>8. Questions regarding the medical condition of a pilot who has applied for or is receiving a benefit(s) pursuant to Section 27 or 28 shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of the applicable benefit plan(s).</p>
<p>E.   Medical Examination Documentation</p>
<p>Upon request, the Company’s aeromedical advisor, the pilot and the pilot’s physician or a physician associated with the Association’s aeromedical office, as applicable, shall be provided a copy of any report or medical record relating to any medical examination, test or evaluation of that pilot conducted pursuant to this Section. However, in cases where the Company’s aeromedical advisor believes that direct pilot access to information contained in the medical records regarding a specific diagnosis of a terminal illness or a psychiatric condition could be detrimental to the pilot or the pilot’s health, the aeromedical advisor may inform the pilot that access will only be provided to a designated representative of the pilot having specific written consent.</p>
<p>F.   Effect on Certain Legal Rights</p>
<p>Nothing in this Section shall be construed to guarantee, deny or limit a pilot’s right to FAA, NTSB or judicial appeal procedures, nor shall it preclude the Company from assisting a pilot with medical problems to regain his medical certificate and return to flight status. This assistance may also include directing the pilot to challenge or appeal the results of adverse findings to the Federal Air Surgeon. All costs of any Company directed challenge/appeal shall be paid by the Company.</p>
<p>G.   Limitation of Medical Procedures</p>
<p>1. Flight Management shall not require a pilot to submit to a psychological or psychiatric examination. However, flight management may refer a pilot to the Company’s aeromedical advisor in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_15D1" target="_blank">Section 15.D.1.</a> (reasonable basis to question fitness). A pilot may be required to undergo a psychological/psychiatric examination if directed by the Company’s aeromedical advisors based on their independent evaluation, in accordance with Section 15. The evaluation conducted by the Company’s aeromedical advisors is expected to include contact with the pilot and any other preliminary evaluation that is necessary in order to reach an independent, informed decision as to the need for further testing.</p>
<p>2. Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed to permit the Company to require a pilot to submit to any medical treatment or invasive procedure which is not consistent with reasonable and current medical practice or which poses an unreasonable threat to the pilot’s health. This paragraph shall not be construed to prohibit testing for drugs, alcohol and, if applicable, other substances pursuant to the provisions of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_15C" target="_blank">Section 15.C.</a></p>
<p>a.   If the Company’s aeromedical advisor determines that a treatment, procedure or evaluation is appropriate in the circumstances of a case, he shall consult with the pilot’s physician or a physician associated with the Association’s aeromedical office, as applicable, for the purpose of determining the permissibility of that treatment, procedure or evaluation under the provisions of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_15G" target="_blank">Section 15.G.</a> (this paragraph). The issue shall be resolved by mutual agreement of those 2 physicians.</p>
<p>b.   If the 2 physicians cannot agree, the matter shall be submitted immediately to a third physician selected by the Company and the Association. The Company, the Association, and the pilot shall be bound by the findings of the third physician. The fees and expenses of the third physician shall be shared equally by the Company and the Association or the pilot; provided, however, that if the third physician agrees with the pilot, the Company shall reimburse the pilot for all reasonable costs incurred in connection with this paragraph.</p>
<p>H.   Confidentiality of Medical Information</p>
<p>All reports and records of any medical examination, test or evaluation of a pilot pursuant to this Section shall be strictly confidential between the Company’s aeromedical advisor and the pilot. Those reports and records shall not be divulged, except in the administration of this Agreement on a “need to know basis” or as required by law, to any other person or entity without the written permission of the pilot. If required by law to divulge, the Company shall provide the pilot notice of such, and upon the request of the pilot, provide the pilot with a copy of such records and reports, unless prohibited by law from doing so. If the final determination of a pilot’s medical condition pursuant to this Section is that the pilot is not medically fit for duty, the Company’s aeromedical advisor may provide a report regarding the pilot’s medical condition to officials in the Benefits Department on a “need to know” basis. Those officials shall receive only as much information as is necessary for them to perform their job functions.</p>
<p>I.   General</p>
<p>Nothing in Section 15 shall be construed to limit the Company’s authority to act in accordance with Section 19. Disciplinary issues arising out of the application of Section 15 shall be handled in accordance with Sections 19 and 21.</p>
</div>
<!-- SECTION 16 -->
<div class="four" id="section16">
<h1 class="persist-header">Section 16: Workers' Compensation Benefits</h1>
<p>A.  Nothing in this Section shall be construed to alter the limits of coverage, or the basis of liability, provided under the workers’ compensation law of any state.</p>
<p>B. Notwithstanding the provisions of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_16A" target="_blank">Section 16.A.</a>, if a pilot suffers an otherwise compensable injury and is ineligible for workers’ compensation benefits due solely to the geographic location at which the injury occurred, the Company shall provide him with benefits no less favorable than the benefits for which he would have been eligible in the state in which he is domiciled.</p>
<p>C. A pilot who is injured while on a trip or other Company business shall notify his Fleet Captain of such injury as soon as practicable. A workers’ compensation claim shall be processed expeditiously.</p>
<p>D. The Company shall reimburse a pilot for all out-of-pocket medical expenses incurred in connection with a workers compensable injury.</p>
<p>E.   If a pilot has sustained a workers’ compensable injury or illness covered by this Section, his occupational illness/injury payments shall be an offset against his workers’ compensation benefits. If, having exhausted his occupational injury/illness leave, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_14F" target="_blank">Section 14.F.</a>, a pilot receives workers’ compensation payments and sick leave pay at the same time, he may use only enough sick leave so that the workers’ compensation payments plus the sick leave pay equals 100 percent of his BLG/RLG.</p>
<p>1. In order to best ensure that medical expenses are covered by workers’ compensation as quickly as possible, an injured pilot should first attempt to contact his Fleet Captain.</p>
<p>2. If the pilot cannot contact his Fleet Captain immediately and needs treatment, the pilot may request the treating facility to call FedEx Risk Management in the pilot’s domicile in order to get the initial treatment expenses billed to Risk Management. If such does not occur, the pilot may always use personal health insurance or pay cash, in order to get required treatment, and the Company shall reimburse all charges (including deductibles and co-payments) for medical treatment through workers’ compensation.</p>
<p>3. The pilot may contact his Fleet Captain to ensure expeditious reimbursement by workers’ compensation.</p>

<div class="four" id="section17">
<h1 class="persist-header">Section 17: Prisoner of War or Hostage Benefits</h1>
<p>A.  A pilot who, while on a trip or on other Company business, and as a result of war, rebellion, insurrection, terrorist act or action of a foreign government, becomes missing or interned, or is hijacked, or taken a prisoner of war by a foreign government, shall continue to accrue seniority and longevity during the period of his absence.</p>

<p>2. Counseling sessions and Advisory Letters do not constitute disciplinary action and may not be grieved. An Advisory letter is a non-disciplinary form letter issued to a pilot to communicate policy, procedures or work rules, which if violated in the future, could lead to discipline.</p>
<p>3. Standard for Discipline</p>
<p>a.   The discipline standard for non-probationary pilots shall be “just cause.”</p>
<p>b.   Probationary pilots shall be considered to be employed on an “at will” basis for purposes of administering and reviewing discipline.</p>
<p>B.   Documentation</p>
<p>1. The Company shall provide a pilot with a copy of any written record of disciplinary action or advisory letter within 10 days after that record is placed in his personnel file.</p>
<p>2. A pilot shall have 60 days from the date on which the written record is received or reasonably should have been received, to place a written response concerning that action in his personnel file.</p>
<p>3. A pilot may examine his personnel file on any business day during normal business hours with adequate notice to his Fleet Captain.</p>
<p>4. An irregularity report or documents referring to an irregularity report (except for Advisory or Disciplinary Letters) shall not be placed in a pilot’s personnel file.</p>
<p>C.   Consideration of Prior Disciplinary Action</p>
<p>An Advisory Letter or a Disciplinary Letter (e.g., a letter of warning, suspension, or termination) may be used to establish that a pilot was given notice of a policy, procedure or work rule, and/or that discipline could result from future violations of such policy, procedure or work rule, no matter the date of issuance of such Letter.</p>
<p>An Advisory or Disciplinary Letter shall not serve as a basis for discipline after a period of 1 year during which the pilot receives no further Advisory or Disciplinary Letters. However, an Advisory or Disciplinary Letter may be considered in assessing future discipline involving similar misconduct for up to 2 years after the receipt of the most recent Advisory or Disciplinary Letter.</p>
<p>D.   Investigation</p>
<p>1. The Company shall investigate and understand a pilot’s performance and conduct before taking any disciplinary action against that pilot. Part of a proper investigation may include management talking or meeting with a pilot or group of pilots to determine the facts and circumstances surrounding a situation. Depending on the circumstances of the particular case, some or all of the necessary fact gathering may occur prior to or without the need for a hearing of any type.</p>
<p>2. A pilot may request Association representation at a Company investigatory interview/meeting. When a pilot makes such a request, the Company shall either:</p>
<p>a. afford the pilot the opportunity to secure Association representation before initiating or continuing the interview/meeting;</p>
<p>b.   refrain from or discontinue the interview/meeting immediately; or</p>
<p>c.   offer the pilot the choice of either continuing the interview/meeting without Association representation or rescheduling the interview/meeting within a reasonable period of time, to allow the pilot the opportunity to arrange for Association representation.</p>
<p>3. Under no circumstances shall flight management require a pilot to submit to a psychological or psychiatric examination. However, a pilot may be required to undergo a psychological/psychiatric examination if directed by the Company’s aeromedical advisors, in accordance with Section 15.</p>
<p>E.   Discipline</p>
<p>A pilot shall not be disciplined without first being afforded the opportunity for a hearing.</p>
<p>1. Hearing</p>
<p>a.   Notice of Hearing</p>
<p>i. The Company shall send the pilot and the Association a Notice of Hearing setting forth the date, time and place of the hearing, together with a statement of facts and specific subject matter(s) to be addressed. The Notice of Hearing shall be sent to the pilot and Association a reasonable amount of time prior to the hearing considering the time needed to prepare as well as the interest in concluding the matter without undue delay.</p>
<p><em>Intent: The following example applies to <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_19E1" target="_blank">Section 19.E.1.</a></em></p>
<p>Example: The Company believes a pilot may have falsified his employment materials by significantly overstating his flight hours and by indicating that he had never received any discipline from a former employer. The following notice would satisfy this paragraph: “You are directed to attend a hearing on April 2 at 10:00 in my office. It has been alleged that you may have falsified your employment materials. If true, these allegations could warrant discipline.”</p>
<p>ii.    Accompanying the Notice of Hearing, the Company shall attach the relevant document(s), excluding witness statements and notes, which prompted the flight manager to send the Notice of Hearing.</p>
<p>b.   The hearing shall be conducted by the Assistant System Chief Pilot or a Fleet Captain. A written decision shall be issued within 15 days following the close of the hearing. If the decision is to discipline the pilot, the decision shall state the discipline and specific grounds for that discipline.</p>
<p>c.   After an initial discussion in which the Company may ask questions and receive answers from the pilot, if requested by the pilot or the Association, the Company shall produce documentary information (including written witness statements and information in electronic format), known and in its possession, but excluding notes except to the extent that the notes contain information from fact or expert witnesses, and names of witnesses excluding confidential witnesses.</p>
<p>i. Disputes whether a witness shall be considered confidential shall be resolved by referring the issue to the arbitrator hearing the underlying case, or an arbitrator selected from the panel of arbitrators by mutual agreement. The parties shall present the issue to the arbitrator so that the System Board hearing on the underlying dispute is not delayed.</p>
<p>ii.    Information provided along with the Notice of Hearing, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_19E1aii" target="_blank">Section 19.E.1.a.ii.</a>, need not be reproduced under this paragraph.</p>
<p>d.   The pilot shall be afforded the opportunity to respond to information described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_19E1c" target="_blank">Section 19.E.1.c.</a> before a decision is rendered. If necessary, the hearing shall be delayed or continued in order to provide the pilot with adequate time to prepare and/or respond. The Company may continue to investigate the circumstances of a particular case and to gather additional documentation after the close of the hearing.</p>
<p>e.   If a pilot is unavailable due to his arrest and detainment by government officials, the Company shall notify the Association, and shall take reasonable steps to notify the pilot of the hearing and to accommodate his participation to the extent permitted under the circumstances. After those prerequisites have been met, the pilot’s unavailability shall not prevent the Company from conducting a hearing regarding the pilot.</p>
<p>2. Internal Appeal</p>
<p>a. If the decision is to terminate the pilot, the case shall automatically be appealed to the Vice President, Flight Operations. The appeal hearing shall be conducted by the Vice President, or his designee, within 15 days after the decision to terminate the pilot.</p>
<p>b. If the decision imposes discipline less than termination, the pilot or the Association may appeal the decision to the System Chief Pilot. Appeals shall be in writing and shall be filed within 15 days after the pilot receives notice of the decision. The appeal hearing shall be conducted by the System Chief Pilot, or his designee, within 15 days after his receipt of the appeal.</p>
<p>c. The hearing officer for the appeal shall be different from the hearing officer for the initial hearing.</p>
<p>d. After an initial discussion in which the Company may ask questions and receive answers from the pilot, if requested by the pilot or the Association, the Company shall produce documentary information (including written witness statements and information in electronic format but excluding notes maintained by management personnel) gathered since the close of the initial hearing.</p>
<p>e. [Reserved]</p>
<p>f. The hearing officer shall issue a written decision within 15 days following the close of the hearing. If the decision is to discipline the pilot, the decision shall state the discipline and specific grounds for that discipline. If the hearing officer fails to issue a <a id="_idTextAnchor429"></a>written decision <a id="_idTextAnchor430"></a>in a timely manner, the <a id="_idTextAnchor431"></a>pilot and/or Association shall not be deemed to have waived any arguments to the System Board regarding any claim for relief based on the untimely decision. Nothing in this paragraph diminishes the Company’s obligation to issue a timely decision.</p>
<p>3. The Association has the right to have a representative present at any disciplinary hearing. The Association shall be given notice prior to any disciplinary hearing in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_19F5" target="_blank">Section 19.F.5.</a></p>
<p>4. Appeal To System Board of Adjustment</p>
<p>If the pilot disagrees with the decision at the internal appeal level, the pilot may appeal the decision, through the Association, to the System Board of Adjustment as described in Section 21. The appeal shall be in writing and shall be made within 15 days following the date on which the pilot received notice of the decision. Copies of the appeal shall be sent to the Association, the Vice President, Flight Operations and the designated official in the Company’s Labor Relations Department.</p>
<p>F.   General</p>
<p>1. If, as a result of any hearing or appeal, the original discipline imposed on a pilot is reduced or rescinded, the pilot’s pay, benefits, seniority and longevity shall be restored consistent with the hearing officer’s decision, and the pilot’s file shall reflect such resolution.</p>
<p>2. Time limits and hearing/appeal dates may be modified, orally or in writing, by agreement of the parties. Oral agreements shall be confirmed in writing as soon as practicable. Requests for modifications shall not be unreasonably denied.</p>
<p>3. For the purpose of computing the time limits stated herein, an appeal shall be deemed “filed,” and a decision shall be deemed “issued,” on the day in which the appeal or decision is postmarked, or if Federal Express is used, on the day in which the appeal or decision is submitted to the Company for shipment, or if a facsimile machine or electronic mail is used to transmit the appeal or decision, on the day in which the appeal or decision is transmitted by such means.</p>
<p>4. For the purpose of Section 19, the term “day” means business day. However, if the last day of a time limit falls on a Corporate or ALPA Holiday (currently including New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, President’s Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Thanksgiving Day and the following Friday, Christmas, or the day on which such holiday is observed by the Company or ALPA), the time limit shall be extended through the first business day following the holiday. The parties shall advise each other expeditiously of any changes to ALPA or Corporate holidays.</p>
<p>5. Delivery of all notices, Advisory Letters, Disciplinary Letters, decisions and appeals pursuant to Section 19 shall be made in person, by Federal Express Overnight Letter, by certified mail, return receipt requested, Company electronic mail, or by other methods which provide verification of receipt. Such correspondence shall be made to the pilot’s Company electronic mail address and to the pilot’s permanent, primary address. Such correspondence shall also be sent to the MEC Representation Department and the MEC Grievance Committee Chairman. A pilot shall be deemed to have received notice upon the earlier of the pilot’s actual receipt of notice or 20 days after transmission of the electronic mail message.</p>
<p>6. Every participant in disciplinary proceedings shall be free to discharge his duty without fear of retaliation by the Association or the Company. No participant shall be coerced or harassed by the Association or the Company.</p>
<p>7. Copies of recordings or other transcriptions made at any meeting or hearing conducted pursuant to this Section shall be provided to all parties, upon request, without undue delay, after it has been finalized. Failure to respond to a request without undue delay shall render that recording or transcript inadmissible until the requesting party has had sufficient time to review the recording or transcript.</p>
<p>8. Grievants and a reasonable number of witnesses and Association representatives involved in the resolution of disputes pursuant to Section 19 may be released from Company duty, if necessary, as provided in Section 18 of this Agreement. Expenses and flight pay loss, if any, for line pilot witnesses called by any party, shall be borne by the party who called the witness or otherwise incurred the expense.</p>
<p>9. Letter of Warning In Lieu of Hearing</p>
<p>a.   Absent the Association’s prior assent to the waiver of a preliminary hearing, the Company shall send the Disciplinary Letter, including the hearing waiver language, to the pilot and the Association without first obtaining the pilot’s signature.</p>
<p>b.   The letter will instruct the pilot to indicate his intentions within 7 business days, either by signing and returning the letter to his flight manager (measured from postmark/drop-off), or by communicating to flight management his desire not to waive the hearing.</p>
<p>c.   If the pilot signs the letter and there is no correspondence from the Association within the same 7 day period indicating the Association’s disagreement, no further action is necessary, and the discipline will be fully precedential in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_19C" target="_blank">Section 19.C.</a> absent a specific agreement to the contrary.</p>
<p>d.   If the pilot declines to sign the hearing waiver, then the Company may elect to conduct a <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_19E" target="_blank">Section 19.E.</a> hearing on the matter.</p>
<p>e.   If the pilot signed the hearing waiver, but the Association timely indicates its disagreement in writing by overnight delivery, facsimile, or electronic mail, the Company has two choices:</p>
<p>i. The Company may accept the hearing waiver, in which case the discipline will have precedential effect only with regard to the pilot to whom the discipline was issued; or</p>
<p>ii.    The Company may conduct a preliminary hearing under <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_19E" target="_blank">Section 19.E</a>, in which case, any discipline, and the precedential effect thereof, would be determined in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_19C" target="_blank">Section 19.C.</a></p>
<p>f.   In any case, if the Company offers discipline in the context of a hearing waiver, but ultimately holds a preliminary hearing on the matter (whether under the process described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_19F9d" target="_blank">Section 19.F.9.d.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_19F9e" target="_blank">e.</a>), the offer of discipline and the hearing waiver, and any discussions pertaining to that offer, shall be considered settlement discussions and shall carry the same evidentiary protections that normally accompany such discussions.</p>
<p>10.   When mutually agreeable, the Company may conduct disciplinary hearings pursuant to <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_19E" target="_blank">Section 19.E.</a> by telephonic and/or video conference.</p>
<p>11.    Removal From Service</p>
<p>a.   If a pilot is removed from flying during the disciplinary process set forth in this Section, prior to any disciplinary action being taken, his access to Company communications systems (e.g., e-mail, VIPS, etc.) shall not be restricted or eliminated, and he shall continue to accrue all pay and benefits (e.g., seniority, longevity, retirement, vacation, sick leave) as if he had not been held out of service.</p>
<p>b.   During the disciplinary process set forth in this Section, if (i) a pilot’s use of Company jumpseats has been restricted by the Company and (ii) the pilot does not have a residence within 100 nautical miles of the location of the disciplinary hearing, the Company shall provide him with travel to and from the disciplinary hearing and, if necessary, 1 night’s stay in a hotel room in the location of the disciplinary hearing.</p>
<p>c.   After a pilot has been withheld from service with pay for more than 2 full bid periods, he is not eligible to bid a flying line. Instead, he must bid a pay only line and shall be paid the BLG/RLG for his awarded pay only line. The pilot may elect that he instead be paid the average of his awarded lines’ credit hour values, plus carryover, during the previous 12 bid periods.</p>
<p>12.    Nothing in this Section shall be construed so as to waive or limit any privilege, provided under applicable law, that would protect information from disclosure, including the attorney-client privilege.</p>

A grievance under Section 20 shall be filed in writing with the Vice President, Flight Operations, within 60 days following the date on which the pilot acquired knowledge, or reasonably should have acquired knowledge, of the fact(s) or event(s) giving rise to the grievance. The 60-day filing period for a grievance shall be extended to 90 days in cases where there is written evidence within the 60-day period that a pilot (or the Association on behalf of a pilot) notified either FedEx Labor Relations/Contract Administration or a member of flight management of the underlying issue in an attempt to resolve the matter within the 60 day filing period. A grievance shall contain a statement of the facts and circumstances from which it arises, a citation to the provision(s) of the agreement that has allegedly been violated and the relief or remedy requested.</p>

<p>C.   Discovery</p>
<p>In response to a request by the other party for specific information, and if known and directly relevant to a grievance, a party shall produce names of witnesses and documentary information (including information in electronic format) but excluding notes except to the extent that the notes contain information from fact or expert witnesses. The party shall produce such information as soon as practicable. If necessary, the grievance hearing shall be delayed or continued in order to provide the parties with adequate time to prepare and/or respond.

If the FedEx MEC Grievance Chairman is not the signatory of the grievance, then a copy shall be distributed to the Grievance Chairman as well.</p>
<p>E.   Appeal of Decision</p>
<p>If the decision of the Vice President, Flight Operations, or his designee, is not satisfactory to the pilot or the Association, such decision may be appealed by the Association to the System Board in the manner set forth in Section 21. Such appeal shall be in writing and shall be filed within 15 days following the date on which the signatory of the grievance received the decision. Copies of the appeal shall be sent to the FedEx MEC Grievance Committee Chairman, the Vice President, Flight Operations and the designated officials in the Company’s Labor Relations/Contract Administration Departments.</p>
<p>F.   General</p>
<p>1. Time Limits</p>
<p>a.   Time limits and meeting dates set forth in this Section may be modified, orally or in writing, by mutual agreement of the parties. Oral agreements shall be confirmed in writing as soon as practicable. Requests for modifications shall not be unreasonably denied.</p>
<p>b.   When any hearing or appeal afforded a pilot(s) by this Section is not requested within the respective time limits prescribed herein, including any extension mutually agreed upon, the decision of the Company shall be final and binding.</p>
<p>c.   If the Company fails to schedule or conduct a hearing in a timely manner, or to issue a timely decision as required by this Section, the grievance shall be deemed denied on the deadline for the hearing or decision, provided, however, that:</p>
<p>i. the Company’s obligations under <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_20D1" target="_blank">Section 20.D.1.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_20D4" target="_blank">D.4.</a> shall not be diminished by this provision; and</p>
<p>ii.    the Association shall not be deemed to have waived any arguments to the System Board regarding any claim for relief based on the untimely hearing or decision.</p>
<p>2. For purposes of Section 20, if a time limit is 15 days or less, the term “day” means business day. If a time limit is more than 15 days, the term “day” means calendar day. In any event, if the last day of a time limit falls on a weekend, or on a Corporate or ALPA Holiday (currently including New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, President’s Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Thanksgiving Day and the following Friday, Christmas, or the day on which such holiday is observed by the Company or ALPA), the time limit shall be extended through the first business day following the weekend or holiday.

<p>3. Delivery of all notices, appeals, and discovery requests and responses pursuant to this Section shall be made by Federal Express Overnight Letter, by certified mail, return receipt requested, in person, by facsimile transmission, Company electronic mail, or by other methods which provide verification of receipt.

<p>Each party shall exchange all documents they intend to enter in their case in chief, in support of their respective positions, and make available, in writing, the names of all witnesses they intend to summon whom they deem necessary to the dispute 15 days prior to the date set for the hearing. Nothing herein shall require the parties to present the aforementioned documents or summon the aforementioned witnesses during the course of the hearing. The parties shall not be restricted from entering documents or summoning witnesses who become known subsequent to the 15 day exchange, provided timely notice is given to the opposing party.</p>
<p>E.   Panels of Arbitrators</p>
<p>1. The Association and the Company shall maintain 2 separate panels of 6 arbitrators each: one with arbitrators for disciplinary cases and the other with arbitrators for non-disciplinary cases.</p>
<p>2. Impaneling of Arbitrators</p>
<p>a.   At least 180 days prior to the amendable date, the Association and the Company shall meet to determine whether to retain either of the current panels of arbitrators. If either of the parties decides to replace a panel(s), the parties shall simultaneously exchange a list of 15 arbitrators for each panel to be replaced. An incumbent arbitrator(s) on a panel that is being re-selected may be submitted on a party’s 15 arbitrator list.</p>
<p>b.   Within thirty days following the exchange, the parties shall meet in order to select the subsequent panel(s) of arbitrators.</p>
<p>c.   The selection of arbitrators shall be accomplished as follows:</p>
<p>i. If an arbitrator(s) appeared on both exchanged lists described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_21E2a" target="_blank">Section 21.E.2.a.</a>, such arbitrator(s) shall be accepted as a member of the respective panel. If the panel is not complete, then;</p>
<p>ii.    the parties shall examine each other’s lists and determine whether there are any arbitrators on the other party’s list that are acceptable to both parties. Any such arbitrator(s) shall be accepted as a member of the respective panel. If the panel is not complete, then;</p>
<p>iii.   within 15 days following the meeting, the parties shall simultaneously exchange a second list, containing 7 different arbitrators, and repeat the process described in Section 21.E.2.b., and c.i. and ii. If a panel still is not complete, then;</p>
<p>(a)  the parties shall jointly request the NMB to provide a single list containing 7 arbitrators for each remaining vacancy on that panel (e.g., a list of 14 arbitrators to fill 2 vacancies on a panel).</p>
<p>(b)  following receipt of the list(s), the parties shall examine the list(s) and determine whether any arbitrators are acceptable to both parties. Any such arbitrator(s) shall be accepted as a member of the respective panel. If the panel still is not complete, then;</p>
<p>(c)  any remaining vacancies shall be filled using the alternate strike method based on the list(s) provided by NMB. A coin toss shall determine which party has the first strike. If the alternative strike method is necessary for both panels, then the party losing the coin toss regarding the administrative panel shall have the first strike on the disciplinary panel.</p>
<p>3. Vacancies on a Panel of Arbitrators</p>
<p>a.   Should vacancies occur on either panel of neutral members, other than by operation of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_21E5" target="_blank">Section 21.E.5.</a>, the parties shall attempt to agree on a replacement within 30 days after the vacancy occurs. If the parties are unable to agree on a replacement, the vacancy shall remain unfilled.</p>
<p>b.   If there are too few arbitrators to hear scheduled arbitrations, the parties may select an arbitrator to hear a scheduled arbitration on an ad hoc basis. This arbitrator shall be selected by the alternate strike method from a list of 7 arbitrators provided by the National Mediation Board. A coin toss shall determine which party has the first strike.</p>
<p>4. Scheduling of Neutral Members of the System Boards</p>
<p>a.   In September of each year the Company and the Association shall schedule mutually agreeable dates on which the neutral members of the System Boards shall conduct System Board proceedings during the following calendar year. The slotting of neutral members into the scheduled dates shall be done by mutual agreement. If by September 20 of each year, the parties have been unable to agree upon such slotting, then on the first business day thereafter, the parties shall meet to determine such slotting by drawing the panel members’ names (first draw determined by coin toss) and slotting them in the order drawn.</p>
<p>b.   If necessary, additional dates for System Board proceedings will be scheduled by mutual agreement of the Company and the Association.</p>
<p>5. Removal of Neutral</p>
<p>a.   Bilateral</p>
<p>The Association and the Company may, by mutual agreement, remove an arbitrator from a panel(s). Within 30 days after the arbitrator’s removal, the parties shall meet to determine whether the vacancy should be filled or left vacant. If either party wishes to fill the vacancy, then the following shall apply:</p>
<p>i. The Association and the Company shall simultaneously exchange a list of 7 arbitrators within 10 days after the removal.</p>
<p>ii.    Thirty days following the exchange, the Association and the Company shall meet in order to select the arbitrator. The selection of the arbitrator shall be accomplished as follows:</p>
<p>(a)  If a single arbitrator appeared on both exchanged lists, such arbitrator shall be accepted as a member of the panel.</p>
<p>(b)  If more than one arbitrator appeared on both exchanged lists, the replacement arbitrator shall be selected by an alternative strike method among the arbitrators appearing on both lists, with a coin toss to determine which party has the first strike.</p>
<p>(c)  If no arbitrator appeared on both lists, the parties shall determine whether either party is willing to accept an arbitrator from the other party’s list. If a mutually acceptable arbitrator is found, such arbitrator shall be impaneled. If not, then the parties shall use the process described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_21E2ciii" target="_blank">Section 21.E.2.c.iii.</a>(a) through (c) to fill the vacancy.</p>
<p>b.   Unilateral</p>
<p>Each party shall have the opportunity to remove a total of three arbitrators during the term of the Agreement, but no more than one in any period of 12 months. A party exercising a unilateral removal shall inform the other party, in writing, of its removal.</p>
<p>i. The arbitrator shall be considered removed as of the date of the notice of removal, provided, however, that a System Board for which an appeal has been filed shall continue to retain jurisdiction over the dispute(s).</p>
<p>ii.    If the removed arbitrator originally appeared on both parties’ list, then his replacement shall be accomplished as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_21E5ai" target="_blank">Section 21.E.5.a.i.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_21E5aii" target="_blank">ii.</a></p>
<p>iii.   If the removed arbitrator originally appeared only on one party’s list, then, within 30 days following the removal, that party shall submit a list of 7 arbitrators. Within 15 days following receipt of the list, the parties shall determine whether there is a mutually acceptable arbitrator. If not, then the parties shall use the process described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_21E2ciii" target="_blank">Section 21.E.2.c.iii.</a>(a) through (c) to fill the vacancy.</p>
<p>6. Unless otherwise agreed, all arbitrators, whether on lists submitted by the parties or obtained from the NMB, shall be members of the National Academy of Arbitrators experienced in airline arbitrations.</p>
<p>F.   General Provisions</p>
<p>1. Time limits and meeting dates may be modified, orally or in writing, by mutual agreement of the parties. Oral agreements shall be confirmed in writing as soon as practicable. Requests for modifications shall not be unreasonably denied. When any appeal to the System Board is not requested within the respective time limits prescribed herein, including any extension mutually agreed upon, the decision of the Company shall be final and binding.</p>
<p>2. For purposes of Section 21, if a time limit is 15 days or less, the term “day” means business day. If a time limit is more than 15 days, the term “day” means calendar day. In any event, if the last day of a time limit falls on a weekend, or on a Corporate or ALPA Holiday (currently including New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, President’s Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Thanksgiving Day and the following Friday, Christmas, or the day on which such holiday is observed by the Company or ALPA), the time limit shall be extended through the first business day following the weekend or holiday. The parties shall inform each other expeditiously of any changes in Corporate or ALPA holidays.</p>
<p>3. The Association, the Company and, if applicable, the individual grievant pilot are parties to all System Board proceedings.</p>
<p>4. Every participant in System Board proceedings shall be free to discharge his duty without fear of retaliation by the Association or the Company. No participant shall be coerced or harassed by the Association or the Company.</p>
<p>5. The reasonable expenses and fees of neutral members and any line pilot witnesses summoned by the System Board, and the cost of facilities selected for System Board proceedings shall be borne equally by the Company and the Association. A party may order a transcript or other record of a System Board proceeding. A copy of such record shall be made available to a party upon request, provided the requesting party agrees to pay a pro-rata share of the cost of making such record. All other costs associated with System Board proceedings, including, but not limited to, expenses and, if applicable, flight pay loss for line pilot witnesses called by any party, shall be borne by the party who called the witness or otherwise incurred the expense.</p>
<p>6. If applicable, a schedule for submission of post-hearing briefs shall be established immediately prior to the close of the hearing.</p>
<p>7. Proceedings of the System Board shall be conducted at locations selected by agreement of the Company and the Association. In making such selections, the Company and the Association shall endeavor to minimize costs. In the absence of an agreement, proceedings shall be conducted in Memphis, Tennessee.</p>
<p>8. The grievant(s) and a reasonable number of witnesses and Association representatives involved in the resolution of disputes pursuant to this Section may be released from Company duty pursuant to the provisions of Section 18 of this Agreement. The arbitrator hearing the underlying dispute shall resolve disputes regarding whether the number of Grievants and witnesses to be released from Company duty is disruptive to Company operations. The Parties shall present the issue to the arbitrator so that the System Board hearing on the underlying dispute is not delayed by disputes regarding the number of grievants or witnesses to be released from Company duty. Pilots participating as a witness, representative or member in a System Board proceeding shall be authorized round trip business jumpseat status to prepare for and attend such proceeding.</p>
<p>9. Delivery of all notices, decisions and appeals pursuant to Section 21, and any other documentation pursuant to Section 21 shall be made by Federal Express Overnight Letter, by certified mail, return receipt requested, in person, by facsimile transmission, <a id="_idTextAnchor433"></a>Company electronic mail<a id="_idTextAnchor434"></a>, or by other methods which provide verification of receipt. Such correspondence shall be sent to the pilot’s Company electronic mail address and the pilot’s permanent primary address. A pilot shall be deemed to have received notice upon the earlier of the pilot’s actual receipt of notice or 20 days after <a id="_idTextAnchor435"></a>the transmission<a id="_idTextAnchor436"></a> of the <a id="_idTextAnchor437"></a>electronic mail message. Such correspondence shall also be sent to the FedEx MEC Representation Department, and the FedEx MEC Grievance Committee Chairman. Whenever a party sends correspondence or other documentation to an arbitrator related to a case under this Section, the other party shall be copied on such correspondence or documentation using the same delivery method by which the arbitrator was sent his copy. Correspondence by email is acceptable among System Board members unless the neutral provides otherwise.</p>
<p>10.    By mutual agreement between the Company and the Association, a neutral from the disciplinary panel may hear a non-disciplinary case, and vice versa.</p>
<p>11.    At any System Board proceeding, the Company and ALPA may be represented, respectively, by an employee or agent of the Company or a representative or agent of ALPA.</p>
<p>12.    System Board Awards</p>
<p>a.   If a System Board Member dissents from an award issued by the majority of the System Board, the dissenting Member may submit a written dissent within 30 days of the majority’s execution of the award, which shall be attached to the award.</p>
<p>b.   If a System Board Member dissents from an award issued by the majority of the System Board and has not executed the award within 30 days after the award is executed by a majority of the System Board, the majority’s award shall be final and binding without the dissenting Member’s signature.</p>

<h1 class="persist-header">Section 22: Seniority</h1>
<p>A.   Federal Express Pilots’ Master Seniority List</p>
<p>1. The Federal Express Pilots’ Master Seniority List (referred to throughout this Agreement as the Master Seniority List), containing the name of each pilot and his relative placement on the list, shall continue to be maintained. The list will include both pilot and engineer seniority numbers. The list shall be brought up to date as of July 1 of each year and will be posted within 30 days thereafter. The effective date shall appear on the list.</p>
<p>2. The seniority of a pilot employed on or after May 31, 1999 shall accrue from his date of hire. When 2 or more pilots have the same date of hire, those pilots shall be placed on the Master Seniority List in order of the last four digits of their social security numbers with the pilot having the highest last four digits of his social security number receiving the more senior placement on the list. If 2 or more pilots have the same date of hire and have the same last four social security digits, their relative placement on the Master Seniority List shall be determined by drawing lots.</p>
<p>B.   Seniority Accrual and Application</p>
<p>1. A pilot who has established seniority shall not lose his seniority except that a pilot shall forfeit all employment and seniority rights and his name shall be removed from the Master Seniority List under the following conditions:</p>
<p>a.   Retirement.</p>
<p>b.   Resignation.</p>
<p>c.   Termination for just cause pursuant to Section 19, 20, and 21.</p>
<p>i. The seniority list will include a terminated pilot’s name until his termination is final, inclusive of System Board proceedings, if any. A terminated pilot’s inclusion on the seniority list does not confer any rights of employment whatsoever.</p>
<p>ii.    Section 20 is included because terminations that result from the application of Section 11 (Training) due to training failures give rise to contractual as opposed to disciplinary grievances.</p>
<p>d.   Failing to return to a flying position upon recall pursuant to the provisions of Section 23.</p>
<p>e.   Failing to return to work at the expiration of a leave of absence.</p>
<p>f.   Termination of probationary pilots pursuant to Sections 19.A.3.b., 20 and 21. Section 20 is included because terminations that result from the application of Section 11 (Training) due to training failures give rise to contractual as opposed to disciplinary grievances.</p>
<p>g.   Failing to be recalled from furlough by the Company for 7 continuous years.</p>
<p>h.   Rejecting an offer of retirement under <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_23A2c" target="_blank">Section 23.A.2.c.</a></p>
<p>2. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, seniority shall govern all pilots in cases of System Bids, bid period schedule awards, vacation awards, ITU training schedules pursuant to Section 24, and retention in case of furlough and recall pursuant to Section 23.</p>
<p>C.   [Reserved]</p>
<p>D.   Protests of Master Seniority List</p>
<p>1. The Master Seniority List as of April 1, 2015, is considered inviolate. Challenges related to such arising from facts and circumstances occurring after April 1, 2015, however, are subject to Section 20 as follows:</p>
<p>a.   Challenges relating to any subsequently published list must be filed on or before March 31 of the year in which the subsequent list is published.</p>
<p>b.   An alleged error(s) on an annually updated Master Seniority List not grieved by March 31 of the year following the year in which the list is published is not grievable at any time in the future.</p>
<p>c.   A pilot who is on leave of absence, vacation, sick leave or is not engaged in active employment with the Company at the time an annually updated Master Seniority List is posted, may file a grievance concerning an alleged error on the most recently published list provided he does so before the earlier of:</p>
<p>i. 30 days following his receipt of the updated Master Seniority List; or</p>
<p>ii.    30 days following his return to active pilot employment.</p>
<p>d.   The Company may correct typographical or clerical errors on the Master Seniority List any time during the year. The Company shall notify the Association in writing of any corrections.</p>
<p>E.   Probationary Pilots</p>
<p>1. A pilot hired before February 28, 2011, shall be employed on a probationary basis for the first 365 days of accumulated active service as a pilot with the Company. A pilot hired on or after February 28, 2011, shall be employed on a probationary basis on his DOH, and continuing for the first 365 days of accumulated active service as a pilot with the Company following the check ride/qualification event that establishes his base month for recurrent training/continuing qualification. Termination of a pilot’s employment during his probationary period shall result in the removal of the pilot from the Master Seniority List, subject to the provisions of Sections 19, 20 and 21.</p>
<p>2. Notwithstanding the provisions of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_22E1" target="_blank">Section 22.E.1.</a>, a probationary pilot is subject to the provisions of Section 23.</p>

<h1 class="persist-header">Section 23: Furlough and Recall</h1>
<p>A.   Furlough</p>
<p>1. Except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_23A1b" target="_blank">23.A.1.b.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_23A2" target="_blank">A.2.</a>, if the Company determines it is necessary to reduce the number of active pilots, the Company shall furlough pilots in reverse order of system seniority as listed on the Master Seniority List. All pilots holding a seniority number at the time of furlough shall be subject to the provisions of Section 23 regardless of their employment status at that time (e.g., active flying service, leave of absence, disability, probationary pilots). Reductions in the number of pilots shall be accomplished as follows:</p>
<p>a.   No furlough shall occur prior to the application of Sections 4.A.2.b. and c.</p>
<p>b.   A pilot shall receive at least 30 calendar days notice with a copy to the Association prior to the effective date of any furlough. In the event he receives less than 30 days notice, he shall be pay protected for 30 days in lieu of that notice. No notice or pay shall be required if the furlough is the result of circumstances beyond the Company’s control.</p>
<p>c.   Prior to the issuance of furlough notices, the Company may offer voluntary furloughs. The Company may limit the offer to 1 or more designated crew statuses. Voluntary furloughs shall be granted in order of system seniority. The Company shall make best efforts to provide pilots at least 30 calendar days notice of the offer of voluntary furloughs, with a copy to the Association.</p>
<p>2. Notwithstanding the provisions of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_23A1" target="_blank">Section 23.A.1.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_23B1" target="_blank">B.1.</a>, the following apply to a pilot subject to a regulated age restriction:</p>
<p>a.   If the pilot is assigned from his current crew position and, as a result of his restriction, he is ineligible to be awarded or assigned any other crew position, the pilot may be furloughed.</p>
<p>b.   The pilot may be bypassed on recall from furlough until there is an available crew position that he is eligible to be awarded or assigned.</p>
<p>c.   A restricted pilot who cannot move to or be accommodated as a Second Officer from another crew position because his relative seniority is less than the current population of Second Officers or there are no Second Officer crew seats, shall be offered the opportunity to retire as provided in the Agreement. Following a pilot’s rejection of the offer, the pilot shall be released from employment as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_22B1" target="_blank">Section 22.B.1.</a>, and shall not be considered as having been furloughed in cases where the only crew status the pilot can occupy is Second Officer.</p>
<p>3. A pilot who is on furlough shall file with the flight personnel department his current mailing address to be used in the event of recall. A pilot shall advise that department in writing of any change in his address.</p>
<p>4. A furloughed pilot shall retain all longevity and seniority accrued prior to furlough and shall continue to accrue longevity for a period of 3 years. A furloughed pilot shall retain and continue to accrue seniority for a period of 7 continuous years.</p>
<p>5. A furloughed pilot shall retain his regular and disability sick accounts in accordance with the provisions of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_14A3" target="_blank">Section 14.A.3.</a></p>
<p>6. A furloughed pilot shall be compensated for any earned and accrued vacation that is unused as of the date of furlough.</p>
<p>7. The continuation of a pilot’s benefits beyond his furlough date shall be governed by applicable state or federal laws except that a pilot shall continue to be eligible for Company related insurance programs for the period, if any, during which he is entitled to receive furlough pay as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_23E" target="_blank">Section 23.E.</a></p>
<p>8. The Company shall notify the Association in writing if it anticipates a furlough or a recall. Upon written request, the Company shall meet and consult with the Association concerning possible adjustments to provisions of this Agreement (e.g., construction of bid period schedules and reducing or eliminating volunteer and draft flying) that may avoid or mitigate the effects of a furlough.</p>
<p>9. A furloughed pilot shall continue to be eligible for employee reduced rate shipping privileges and Company jumpseat privileges, as provided in Section 26, for the period during which he is entitled to receive furlough pay. A furloughed pilot will continue to have access to E-mail, VIPS and IMS for the period during which he is entitled to receive furlough pay. During any period when there are pilots on furlough, the Company shall send the Association a copy of the Career Opportunities Postings, and each update. A furloughed pilot may coordinate with his last flight manager if he desires to apply for any Company positions.</p>
<p>10.    Recall shall be offered to all pilots on furlough prior to the employment of a new hire pilot, except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_23A2b" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_23A2b" target="_blank">Section 23.A.2.b.</a></p>
<p>11.    There shall be no volunteer flying in any crew status while any pilot is on furlough. The Company does not intend to rely on draft flying in order to avoid a recall.</p>
<p>B.   Recall</p>
<p>1. Except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_23A2" target="_blank">Section 23.A.2.</a>, pilots, including pilots who have not completed their probationary period, shall be recalled from furlough in order of system seniority.</p>
<p>2. Furloughed pilots shall be notified of recall in writing (e.g., Federal Express Overnight Letter) with a copy sent to the Association. The notice shall allow the pilot at least 30 days to report for duty. The pilot shall respond in writing (e.g., Federal Express Overnight Letter) within 14 calendar days following his receipt of the recall notice, and state whether he will accept recall.</p>
<p>3. A pilot recalled from furlough shall be returned to the payroll on the day he resumes active employment. Prior to his activation in a crew status, the hourly rate of pay for a pilot who is recalled shall be the current hourly rate for the last crew status held by the pilot prior to his furlough; provided, however, that if that crew status no longer exists, the pilot’s hourly rate of pay prior to activation shall be the hourly rate for the crew status to which the pilot has been recalled.</p>
<p>4. If a recalled pilot is unable to return to active flying service due to medical reasons, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>a.   If the pilot was on disability at the time of furlough, his eligibility for disability benefits shall be governed by Section 27.</p>
<p>b.   If the pilot was on sick leave at the time of furlough he shall not be entitled to sick leave until after he has returned to an active pay status; provided, however that if the pilot would otherwise be entitled to sick leave based on the same injury or illness that caused him to be on sick leave at the time of furlough, he may re-enter sick leave upon recall.</p>
<p>c.   If the pilot was not on sick leave at the time of furlough, he shall not be entitled to sick leave until after he has returned to an active pay status.</p>
<p>d.   If the pilot does not qualify for sick leave or disability, he shall be placed in a medical leave of absence.</p>
<p>e.   For purposes of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_22B1d" target="_blank">Section 22.B.1.d.</a>, the pilot shall be considered as having returned to a flying position.</p>
<p>5. A pilot may decline recall and remain on furlough if a junior pilot remains on furlough; provided, however, a pilot may not decline a recall if the Company has sent notice of recall to all furloughed pilots, and the pilot has not requested and been granted a leave of absence in accordance with Section 13.</p>
<p>6. Even if no junior pilot remains on furlough, a pilot may decline recall and remain on furlough for the duration of any individual contract of employment, not to exceed 24 months, to which he is a party at the time of his recall. The pilot shall provide the Company a copy of his contract of employment.</p>
<p>7. A pilot’s election to decline recall and remain on furlough in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_23B4" target="_blank">Section 23.B.4.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_23B5" target="_blank">5.</a> shall not extend the period of 7 years referred to in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_22B1g" target="_blank">Section 22.B.1.g.</a></p>
<p>8. A pilot who is recalled from furlough shall be guaranteed at least 6 bid periods of active pilot employment following recall.</p>
<p>C.   Incentive Plan</p>
<p>The Company may, at its option, elect to avoid or mitigate a furlough by offering pilots or a specific group of pilots (using age or seniority, unless the Association consents to an alternate selection criteria) voluntary early retirement and/or severance package. If made to a specific group of pilots, any offer shall be made on a uniform and non-discriminatory basis. The Company shall notify, meet and consult with the Association prior to making any offer pursuant to this paragraph.</p>
<p>D.   Non-Flying Employment Opportunities</p>
<p>A pilot to whom a furlough notice has been issued may compete for available non-flying employment with the Company for which he is qualified for a period of 90 days following the effective date of his furlough or until expiration of the period, if any, during which the pilot is entitled to receive furlough pay, whichever is later. If a pilot is offered and accepts non-flying employment, his pay, working conditions and benefits, including any relocation benefits, shall be determined by Company policies pertinent to that position. A furloughed pilot may not work in a non-flying position with the Company at the same time that he is receiving furlough pay as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_23E1" target="_blank">Section 23.E.1.</a> If mutually acceptable to the pilot and the Company, however, such pilot may waive all or a portion of his furlough pay in order to begin his non-flying employment sooner.</p>
<p>E.   Furlough Pay</p>
<p>1. A furloughed pilot shall receive furlough pay based on his longevity as a pilot, in accordance with the table below.

<p>A furloughed pilot must return his Company identification badge in order to receive furlough pay. Additionally, furloughed pilots must update their current contact information to ensure proper delivery of Company information, including recall notices.</p>
<p>2. A furloughed pilot may elect to reduce the dollar amount of the payments of the furlough pay to which he is entitled by 50%. In this event, the number of bid periods during which the pilot is entitled to receive furlough pay shall be doubled. Any election of this option shall be made prior to the effective date of furlough and may not be modified after the commencement of the furlough.</p>
<p>3. If a pilot receiving furlough pay is recalled, his furlough pay shall terminate on the date he resumes active employment. However, if the pilot has elected reduced payments in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_23E2" target="_blank">Section 23.E.2.</a>, he shall receive 60 hours of furlough pay per bid period, on a pro-rated basis, if applicable, for the period he was on furlough, not to exceed the maximum furlough pay to which the pilot was entitled pursuant to <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_23E1" target="_blank">Section 23.E.1.</a></p>
<p>4. If a furloughed pilot is on leave of absence on the effective date of furlough, his furlough pay, if any, shall be based on his scheduled or actual return from leave of absence, whichever is later. His furlough pay shall be reduced by a prorated amount for each day he was on leave of absence (or scheduled to be on leave of absence) after the effective date of the furlough.</p>
<p>5. A furloughed pilot who is entitled to reimbursement of expenses under the Agreement shall submit the documentation required for reimbursement to the Company within 30 days of the date when the pilot incurred the reimbursable expense.</p>

<div class="four" id="section24">
<h1 class="persist-header" id="link_24">Section 24: Filling of Crew Positions</h1>
<p>A.   General</p>
<p>1. All crew positions shall be awarded or assigned pursuant to a System Bid conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Section, except as provided otherwise in this Agreement.</p>
<p>2. An eligible pilot’s actual or notional crew position (i.e., base, aircraft and seat) shall be determined by his seniority and standing bid.</p>
<p>3. Certification Requirements</p>
<p>a.   Prior to commencing training for a Captain or First Officer crew position, a pilot must possess a current FAA medical certificate for that crew position, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_15A" target="_blank">Section 15.A.</a>, and an Airline Transport Pilot Certificate.</p>
<p>b.   If a pilot does not possess the requisite certifications as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24A3a" target="_blank">Section 24.A.3.a.</a>, he may be removed from that award/assignment and, if removed, shall remain in his current crew position.</p>
<p>4. Standing Bid</p>
<p>a.    After the close, or cancellation, of each System Bid, a pilot’s standing bid will be reset to reflect only his currently awarded/assigned crew position at 100%.</p>
<p>b.   A pilot may update the standing bid at any time. The standing bid format shall provide a method for percentage bidding on crew positions in 5% increments, measured as a function of each crew position’s Minimum Staffing Level.</p>
<p>c.   Changes to standing bids shall be submitted through the Company’s appropriate electronic system (currently VIPS).</p>
<p>5. A pilot awarded or assigned a new crew position shall not relinquish his current crew position until he has been activated into his new crew position.</p>
<p>a.   If the pilot has been awarded/assigned a training start date and his activation is delayed owing to his performance or unavailability (e.g., leave of absence, sick leave), then the pilot will begin to earn the lower hourly rate of pay 90 days following the pilot’s awarded/assigned training start date, unless his actual activation is sooner.</p>
<p>b.   If the pilot has not been awarded/assigned a training start date, then the pilot will begin to earn the lower hourly rate of pay 90 days following the training start date the pilot would have been assigned but for his unavailability.</p>
<p>Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as a means to pay credit hours, earned by a pilot while operating flight activities, at an hourly rate lower than that rate associated with the aircraft he operated.</p>
<p>6. Once a pilot commences Initial, Transition, or Upgrade (ITU) training, 24-Requalification (24-Requal), 24-Downbid training, or 24-Differences<br/>
            training, he may not perform flight duties in his current crew status, <br/>
            except as follows:</p>
<p>a.   The pilot is returned to his current crew position due to withdrawal from training, or as a result of a training failure; or</p>
<p>b.   The pilot’s illness, injury or other absence(s) causes an unscheduled interruption to his training which then results in a decision to return to his current crew position; or</p>
<p>c.   Whenever unscheduled training interruptions are caused by natural disasters, emergencies, prolonged mechanical malfunctions or extended periods of unavailability of training equipment anticipated to last in excess of 21 days.</p>
<p>7. A pilot may be released from an award or assignment only in extenuating circumstances by the Vice President, Flight Operations.</p>
<p>B.   System Bids</p>
<p>1. Notification of a System Bid shall be communicated to pilots through the appropriate Flight Crew Information File (FCIF). Notification that an active System Bid exists shall be available through the Company’s appropriate electronic system (currently the PFC website).</p>
<p>2. The posting of a System Bid shall contain at least the following information:</p>
<p>a.   For each crew position:</p>
<p>i. The Current Staffing Level;</p>
<p>ii.    The Minimum Staffing Level; and</p>
<p>iii.   The Maximum Staffing Level.</p>

<p>i. Currently awarded/assigned each crew position; and</p>
<p>ii.    Currently activated in each crew position.</p>
<p>c.   Dates and times on which the System Bid opens and closes.</p>
<p>d.   To the extent known, information as to when training related to that System Bid is projected to begin, along with the anticipated training footprint for each ITU type, and anticipated range of monthly training throughput by crew position.</p>
<p>e.   Required certificates for each crew position as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24A3" target="_blank">Section 24.A.3.</a></p>
<p>f.   Additional information as appropriate.</p>
<p>3. Each System Bid shall be published and remain available for bidding for a minimum of 14 days. A System Bid that includes crew positions at a new base (including FDAs) shall be published and remain available for bidding for a minimum of 28 days.</p>
<p>4. The Company shall publish at least one practice bid award between 7 days and 3 days prior to the closing of any System Bid. The results of a practice bid(s) shall be communicated to pilots through the Company’s appropriate electronic system (currently the PFC website) no later than 24 hours after the closing of the practice bid.</p>
<p>5. The published results of a System Bid (as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24C1" target="_blank">Section 24.C.1.</a>) shall be available in the Company’s appropriate electronic system (currently the PFC website) for a minimum of 7 years.</p>
<p>6. A System Bid may not be amended after it is published, but its closing date may be extended after consultation with ALPA. The Company may, however, cancel any System Bid prior to its closing.</p>
<p>7. A System Bid must close, or be canceled, prior to the opening of another System Bid.</p>
<p>8. For the purposes of a System Bid, a pilot shall bid from his currently awarded/assigned crew position. However, a pilot who is assigned from a crew position into which he never activated and to a crew position in the same geographic location as the base associated with his current crew position will not be eligible for the relocation benefits described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_6A2" target="_blank">Section 6.A.2.</a> (Assignment).</p>
<p>9. For the purposes of a System Bid, any award for an FDA pilot, who has not yet met his applicable FDA commitment period when the System Bid closes, shall be a notional award.</p>
<p>10.    For the purposes of a System Bid, any award/assignment for a pilot in pay only sick status when the System Bid closes shall be a notional award/assignment.</p>
<p>C.   Bid Award/Assignment Procedure</p>
<p>1. The effective date of all awards/assignments shall be the closing of the applicable System Bid, regardless of when the awards/assignments are published. Within 10 days following the closing of a System Bid, the Company shall communicate the following to pilots through an FCIF:</p>
<p>a.   Names, employee numbers, and seniority numbers of pilots receiving an award or assignment and the crew position awarded or assigned;</p>
<p>b.   Designation of any awards based on an Assignment Right of Return (ARR);</p>
<p>c.   Anticipated start date for the first training start date in each crew position, along with anticipated range of monthly training throughput for each crew position (Example: 57CM – First TRN Start Date January, 2012 – 6 to 12 per month); and</p>
<p>d.   Miscellaneous additional information.</p>
<p>2. Except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24C2e" target="_blank">Section 24.C.2.e.</a>, the System Bid shall be processed in system-wide seniority order, as follows:</p>
<p>a.   For each crew position for which the Dynamic Staffing Level is less than the Minimum Staffing Level, a pilot will be awarded/assigned such crew position according to his standing bid.</p>
<p>b.   Stand In Bid Award</p>
<p>For each crew position for which the Dynamic Staffing Level is equal to or greater than the published Minimum Staffing Level, but less than the Maximum Staffing Level, a pilot will be awarded such crew position according to his standing bid, provided that:</p>
<p>i. The pilot’s currently awarded/assigned crew position is overstaffed (i.e., Dynamic &gt; Maximum); and</p>
<p>ii.    The pilot is senior to the most junior pilot (in the “TO” crew position) not subject to assignment.</p>
<p>c.   For each crew position for which the Dynamic Staffing Level is greater than or equal to the Maximum Staffing Level (i.e., overstaffed, or staffed to its limit, respectively), the following will apply:</p>
<p>i. A pilot will be awarded as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24C2cib" target="_blank">Section 24.C.2.c.i.(b)</a>, or awarded/assigned as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24C2cia" target="_blank">Section 24.C.2.c.i.(a)</a>, such crew position, provided that he is:</p>
<p>(a)  Subject to assignment from his currently awarded/assigned crew position, and senior to the most junior pilot (in the “TO” position) not subject to assignment; or</p>
<p>(b)  Senior to a pilot in his currently awarded/assigned crew position who:</p>
<p>(1)    is imminently subject to assignment, and</p>
<p>(2)    has the seniority necessary to hold the (“TO”) crew position.</p>
<p>A crew position awarded pursuant to <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24C2cib" target="_blank">Section 24.C.2.c.i.(b)</a> shall be considered a Stand In Bid Award</p>
<p>ii.    A pilot who is subject to assignment, and who is not assigned in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24C2a" target="_blank">Sections 24.C.2.a.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24C2b" target="_blank">b.</a>, or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24C2ci" target="_blank">c.i.</a>, will be assigned to a different crew position as follows:</p>
<p>(a)  If the pilot has not listed a crew position on his standing bid that he can hold as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24C2cia" target="_blank">Section 24.C.2.c.i.(a)</a>, then he will be assigned to the U.S. based crew position with the highest pay rate that his seniority will allow him to hold, and in which he would have the highest relative seniority, from among those crew positions whose Dynamic Staffing Level is less than the Maximum Staffing Level.</p>
<p>(b)  If the pilot cannot hold any crew position as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24C2ciia" target="_blank">Section 24.C.2.c.ii.(a)</a>, he will be assigned to the most junior held, U.S.-based crew position regardless of the Maximum Staffing Level.</p>
<p>d.   For any crew position that is less than the Minimum Staffing Level after the processing of the System Bid is complete, the Company may hire a pilot(s) up to the Minimum Staffing Level for that crew position from that System Bid.</p>
<p>e.   Assignment Right of Return (ARR)</p>
<p>i. A pilot shall have a right of return to the crew position(s) from which he was assigned, beginning upon his activation date into the crew position to which he was assigned, and ending 18 months thereafter.</p>
<p>ii.    On each subsequent, open System Bid (following a pilot’s assignment) during the 18 month period, a pilot may exercise his ARR by listing the applicable crew position(s) in his standing bid above his currently awarded/assigned crew position, at 100%, until the pilot is no longer eligible for any ARR.</p>
<p>(a)  If the pilot does not exercise an ARR for which he is eligible, or he is awarded a crew position which he listed higher in his standing bid than the applicable ARR crew position(s), the ARR is permanently forfeited.</p>
<p>(b)  If a pilot elects to exercise an ARR, the crew position(s) from which he was previously assigned shall be considered in seniority order among only other pilots exercising an ARR to that same crew position, prior to the consideration of any pilots without ARR eligibility, and provided that the Dynamic Staffing Level in that crew position(s) is less than the Maximum Staffing Level.</p>
<p>(1)    If a System Bid results in a pilot being awarded an ARR crew position, his ARR ends.</p>
<p>(2)    If the pilot is not awarded the crew position via the exercise of an ARR, his remaining standing bid shall be considered as otherwise provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24C2" target="_blank">Section 24.C.2.</a></p>
<p>3. FDA Crew Positions</p>
<p>a.   No pilot may be assigned to an FDA crew position unless the pilot includes the FDA crew position in his standing bid in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24C2cia" target="_blank">Section 24.C.2.c.i.(a).</a> If no pilot on the Master Seniority List expresses a preference by standing bid for an FDA crew position, the Company may hire a pilot into it in accordance with &lt;<a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24C2d" target="_blank">Section 24.C.2.d.</a></p>
<p>b.   All pilots awarded or assigned to an FDA are fully covered by all provisions of this Agreement.</p>
<p>c.   A pilot awarded from an FDA, who has not yet met his applicable FDA commitment period, shall receive a notional award and is not eligible to bid on training or base transfer activation (BTA) dates. The Company shall notify the pilot of an assigned training start or BTA date. Such date shall be at least 60 days after the date on which the Company’s notification was posted, and no later than 60 days beyond the fulfillment of the pilot’s minimum FDA commitment period. Exercise of this provision will not create any SDP entitlement for any pilot. Following notification, the date may not be changed without the consent of the pilot.</p>
<p>d.   A pilot assigned from an FDA may elect to hold required training, or a base transfer activation (BTA), in abeyance until the fulfillment of his minimum FDA commitment period, if any, provided the FDA is not being closed prior to the end of such commitment period. This election shall be by written notification to the Crew Staffing department within 10 days following the publication of the applicable System Bid results, as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24C1" target="_blank">Section 24.C.1.</a> If the pilot elects to hold the training or BTA in abeyance, he will not be in the applicable pool for BTA or ITU bidding. The Company shall notify the pilot of an assigned training start or BTA date. Such date shall be at least 60 days after the date on which the Company’s notification was posted, and no later than 60 days beyond the fulfillment of the pilot’s minimum FDA commitment period. Exercise of this provision will not create any SDP entitlement for any pilot. Following notification, the date may not be changed without the consent of the pilot.</p>
<p>4. [Reserved]</p>
<p>5. A pilot released from his currently awarded or assigned crew position in accordance with other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in his current crew position. If the pilot’s current crew position is unavailable for reasons identified in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11J4" target="_blank">Section 11.J.4.</a>, his crew position shall be determined as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11J5" target="_blank">Section 11.J.5.</a></p>
<p>D.   Training/Activation Procedures</p>
<p>1. Except for pilots who are not eligible to participate in a monthly training bid (or BTA bid), System Bids shall be trained (e.g., training slot awards/assignments, denials, BTA awards/assignments) to each crew position’s conclusion, prior to commencing any training in such crew position based upon a subsequent System Bid. Training Bids for two or more separate System Bids may run concurrent for one bid period, as training for the crew position from one System Bid concludes, and the training for the same crew position from another System Bid commences.</p>
<p>2. A pilot’s superseding award/assignment shall take precedence over his prior award/assignment, if any, and his training will correspond to that superseding award/assignment, unless his current crew position is subject to Fleet Retirement and/or Base Closure, in which case the Company may require him to activate first to his prior award/assignment, and thereafter to his superseding award/assignment as follows:</p>
<p>a.   If the pilot could have held the superseding crew position on the System Bid from which his prior award/assignment resulted, then he shall immediately be eligible for training slot awards/assignment from among currently available training slots.</p>
<p>b.   If the pilot could not have held the superseding crew position on the System Bid from which his prior award/assignment resulted, then the award/assignment of his training slot for the superseding crew position shall be handled in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24D4" target="_blank">Section 24.D.4.</a></p>
<p>3. Notwithstanding <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24D2" target="_blank">Section 24.D.2.</a>, a pilot who has already begun to train for his prior award/assignment must activate prior to being awarded/assigned to a training or BTA date for his superseding award.</p>
<p>4. Pilots who are awarded or assigned to a crew position on a System Bid and who require training shall be pooled in their (“TO”) crew position, and shall bid and be awarded training dates in their (“TO”) crew position in a Training Bid as follows:</p>
<p>a.   At least 18 days prior to the closing of the monthly bid for First Officers, the Company shall electronically publish a Training Bid Package, which shall include at least the following:</p>
<p>i. Training start dates for all known training slots eligible to be bid upon and beginning in the applicable bid period;</p>
<p>Example: Prior to the opening of the monthly bid for the November bid period, the pilot shall be afforded the opportunity to bid for training that begins in the November bid period.</p>
<p>ii.    The number of training slots available for each of the four training types (i.e., Initial/Transition/Upgrade (ITU), 24-Requal, 24-Downbid, and 24-Differences) for each training start date;</p>
<p>iii.   A list of all eligible pilots who have yet to be awarded or assigned to a training slot, ordered by seniority number, including name, employee number, and minimum syllabus requirement; and</p>
<p>iv.    A closing date for the Training Bid, which shall be at least 168 hours after its publication.</p>
<p>b.   Awards, Denials, and Assignments of training slots shall be as follows:</p>
<p>i. A pilot desiring to begin training in the upcoming bid period, on any of the available dates listed, shall submit a training bid; if no training bid is submitted, he is deemed to have not bid for any of those dates.</p>
<p>ii.    Except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24D4biii" target="_blank">Section 24.D.4.b.iii.</a> through viii., pilots will be awarded to training slots in seniority order. Pilots requiring Initial, Transition, or Upgrade training may only bid for an ITU training slot (an ITU training slot is considered one training type). Pilots requiring only a 24-Requal may only bid for a 24-Requal training slot. Pilots requiring only a 24-Downbid may only bid for a 24-Downbid slot. Pilots requiring only 24-Differences training may only bid for a 24-Differences slot.</p>
<p>iii.   A bid for a training slot that conflicts with a carryover trip, or carryover block of R-days, from the previous bid period, shall be deemed an invalid bid. A training slot conflicts with a carryover trip if there are less than 48 hours between the scheduled termination of the carryover trip (at the time of the Training Bid processing), and the beginning of the local base day (e.g., 0130 LBT) on which the training slot is scheduled to start. A training slot conflicts with a carryover block of R-days unless there are at least two local base days between the last scheduled carryover R-day, and the local base day on which the training slot is scheduled to start. This 48 hour buffer may not be waived.</p>
<p>iv.    Denial of Training Slots</p>
<p>(a)  The Company may choose to deny a pilot a training slot award, or bypass a pilot when inversely assigning training slots, because of:</p>
<p>(1)    Staffing needs in the “FROM” crew position;</p>
<p>(2)    Regulated age considerations;</p>
<p>(3)    The Company’s desired syllabus type for a given training slot does not satisfy the pilot’s minimum required training syllabus type; or</p>
<p>(4)    New hire training requirements.</p>
<p>(b)  A pilot who is denied a training slot award shall be entitled to Slot Denial Payment(s) (SDP) in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24E" target="_blank">Section 24.E.</a></p>
<p>(c)  The denied training slot shall be awarded to the next eligible, junior pilot(s) who bid for that slot, except when he is also denied by operation of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24D4biva" target="_blank">Section 24.D.4.b.iv.(a).</a> If there are no remaining junior pilot(s), that training slot shall be considered unfilled.</p>
<p>v. For any training slots left unfilled in a training start date, the Company may assign those training slots in inverse seniority order, beginning with the most junior eligible pilot including new hire pilots, if any. A pilot inversely assigned to a training slot shall have a 48 hour duty free buffer prior to the beginning of the pilot’s training start date.</p>
<p>(a)  Trips in conflict with the 48 hour duty free buffer shall be removed. The pilot shall earn trip guarantee for the trip, and shall be eligible for substitution for that portion of the trip’s footprint not in conflict with the 48 hour duty free buffer.</p>
<p>(b)  R-days in conflict with the 48 hour duty free buffer shall be removed, and the credit hour value of such R-days shall be credited toward the pilot’s leveling and RLG.</p>
<p>vi.    [Reserved]</p>
<p>vii.   If a pilot is inversely assigned to a training slot as the result of a more junior, eligible pilot being bypassed as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24D4bv" target="_blank">Section 24.D.4.b.v.</a>, he shall be eligible for inverse SDP, in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24E8" target="_blank">Section 24.E.8.</a></p>
<p>viii.  If the Company elects not to inversely award a training slot, or an awarded/assigned training slot becomes vacant, the Company may use the slot to qualify a pilot who is otherwise available to fly but for his lack of qualification, including but not limited to, pilots returning from leaves of absence, LTD, and pilots who have experienced training failures. If no such pilot exists, then the slot may be used to train new hires and/or Flight Training Personnel (e.g., Instructor Pilots, PCAs, non-pilot instructors). Thereafter, the Company may offer any remaining unused training slot(s) to pilots who do not have an awarded/assigned training slot (in seniority order among the pilots who bid for training that month, then among all remaining pilots who do not have an awarded/assigned training slot).</p>
<p>ix.    The Training Bid awards, denials, and assignments shall be published no later than the opening of the monthly bid.</p>
<p>c.   Pre-Bid Period Package Training Bid</p>
<p>If the Company desires to begin training prior to the Training Bid as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24D4a" target="_blank">Section 24.D.4.a.</a>, the Company shall provide the ability for pilots to bid and be awarded training dates as follows:</p>
<p>i. The Company shall announce any Pre-Bid Period Package Training Bid via FCIF. The FCIF shall include:</p>
<p>(a)  Training start dates that shall not begin less than 14 days after the close of the System Bid;</p>
<p>(b)  The number of training slots available for each of the four training types (i.e., Initial/Transition/Upgrade, 24-Requal, 24-Downbid, and 24-Differences), for each training start date;</p>
<p>(c)  A list of all pilots who have yet to be awarded/assigned a training start date, ordered by seniority number and including name, employee number, and minimum syllabus requirement; and</p>
<p>(d)  A closing date for the Pre-Bid Period Package Training Bid, which shall be no less than 5 days after the date on which the FCIF is issued.</p>
<p>ii.    The awarding (and any denial and/or assignment) of Pre-Bid Period Package training slots shall be the same as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24D4b" target="_blank">Section 24.D.4.b.</a></p>
<p>5. Award/Assignment of Base Transfer Activation (BTA) Dates</p>
<p>Pilots who are awarded or assigned to a crew position on a System Bid but do not require training shall be pooled in their “TO” crew position.</p>
<p>a.   Separate and apart from the Training Bid, the Company shall also conduct a single BTA bid (i.e., not monthly). Such bid will include a list of all available BTA dates applicable to the most recent System Bid’s awards/assignments, with the awarded/assigned BTA dates handled in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25C6" target="_blank">Section 25.C.6.</a></p>
<p>b.   Among pilots who submit a BTA bid with a sufficient number of choices, for each “TO” crew position, those will be awarded a BTA date in system seniority order.</p>
<p>c.   Among pilots who submit a BTA bid with an insufficient number of choices, for each “TO” crew position, as well as those pilots who submit no BTA bid, they will be assigned BTA dates as follows:</p>
<p>i. For pilots who were awarded the crew position to which their base transfer applies, BTA dates will be assigned in seniority order, beginning with the first available BTA date from among those BTA dates remaining unawarded via the BTA bid.</p>
<p>ii.    For pilots who were assigned the crew position to which their base transfer applies, BTA dates will be assigned in inverse seniority order, beginning with the first available BTA date from among those BTA dates remaining unawarded after the application of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24D5ci" target="_blank">Section 24.D.5.c.i.</a></p>
<p>6. Training Slot or BTA Date Award/Assignments When Returning from Pay Only Sick</p>
<p>Training for a pilot who received a crew position award/assignment (whether notional or actual) on a System Bid, and who is returning from a pay only sick status, shall be handled as follows:</p>
<p>a.   If the System Bid on which the pilot received his crew position award/assignment has been trained to completion, the pilot shall be assigned to start training within 60 days of his return from sick status.</p>
<p>b.   If the System Bid on which the pilot received his crew position award/assignment has not been trained to completion and if he does not require full requalification training (i.e., training with a footprint similar to ITU) or 24-Requal in his current crew position upon his return from sick status, the pilot shall be eligible to bid for and/or be assigned to training dates (for his awarded/assigned crew position).</p>
<p>c.   If the System Bid on which the pilot received his crew position award/assignment has not been trained to completion and if he requires full requalification training (i.e., training with a footprint similar to ITU) in his current crew position upon his return from sick status, the pilot shall be assigned to start training for his awarded/assigned crew position within 60 days of his return from sick status.</p>
<p>d.   If the System Bid on which the pilot received his crew position award/assignment has not been trained to completion and if the pilot requires 24-Requal training in his current crew position upon his return from sick status:</p>
<p>i. the pilot will be assigned to start training for his awarded/assigned crew position within 60 days of his return from sick status if a junior pilot in the case of a crew position award (or a senior pilot in the case of a crew position assignment) has been awarded/assigned a training date.</p>
<p>ii.    the pilot will be assigned to start 24-requal training within 60 days of his return from sick status if a junior pilot in the case of a crew position award (or a senior pilot in the case of a crew position assignment) has not been awarded/assigned a training date. Such pilot shall be eligible to bid for and/or be assigned to training dates (for his awarded/assigned crew position) following completion of his 24-Requal training.</p>
<p>e.   If the pilot’s crew position award/assignment requires a BTA but the pilot requires requalification training in his current crew position, he will be assigned to start requalification training within 60 days of his return from sick status. His BTA shall be effective on the first day of the first full bid period following the completion of requalification training.</p>
<p>If the pilot’s crew position award/assignment requires a BTA but the pilot does not require requalification training in his current crew position, his BTA shall be effective on the first day of the first full bid period following his return from sick status.</p>
<p>7. Denial of Training Slots Due to Regulated Age</p>
<p>a.   The Company may deny a training slot award to a pilot who is within 24 months of the regulated age, as of the training start date associated with the slot he would otherwise have been awarded.</p>
<p>b.   The Company may bypass a pilot for a training slot assignment if that pilot is within 24 months of the regulated age, as of the training start date associated with the slot he would otherwise have been assigned.</p>
<p>c.   No later than the close of the applicable Training Bid, the Company shall post a notification to any pilot who is denied a training slot award due to regulated age. The denied pilot shall not appear on subsequent Training Bids under <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24D4aiii" target="_blank">Section 24.D.4.a.iii.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24D4cic" target="_blank">D.4.c.i.(c).</a></p>
<p>d.   A pilot denied a training slot award in accordance with Section 24.D.7.a., and whose crew position award was not the result of a down/lateral bid, will be eligible for Regulated Age SDP as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24E3" target="_blank">Section 24.E.3.</a></p>
<p>e.   If the regulated age is raised after a pilot has been denied a training slot in accordance with Section 24.D.7.a., and as a result his age is no longer within 24 months of the new regulated age (measured using the same standard as in Section 24.D.7.a.), he shall elect to either:</p>
<p>i. Forgo the award, in which case his eligibility for Regulated Age SDP shall cease immediately (i.e., no SDP will be paid to the pilot after the date on which he makes this election); or</p>
<p>ii.    Enter into the Training Bid procedures as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24D4a" target="_blank">Section 24.D.4.a.</a> and b.</p>
<p>f.   Once a pilot is eligible for Regulated Age SDP based on the highest Captain hourly rate, he will not, on subsequent System Bids, be awarded any crew positions that are also restricted by regulated age, except as provided in Section 24.D.7.g.</p>
<p>g.   A pilot who is eligible for Regulated Age SDP shall participate in subsequent System Bids if the Maximum Staffing Level in his currently awarded crew position is lower than its Current Staffing Level. In such case, the pilot may be awarded or assigned a new crew position by operation of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24C" target="_blank">Section 24.C.</a> That pilot may become eligible for Regulated Age SDP (for his newly awarded or assigned crew position) by operation of Section 24.D.7.</p>
<p>h.   A pilot who is eligible for Regulated Age SDP may be assigned to a training date for the crew position upon which his Regulated Age SDP is based, if he can no longer hold his current crew position.</p>
<p>E.   Slot Denial Payment (SDP)</p>
<p>1. If a pilot is denied a training slot as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24D4biva" target="_blank">Section 24.D.4.b.iv.(a)</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24D4cii" target="_blank">D.4.c.ii.</a>, he will be entitled to a Slot Denial Payment (SDP). The SDP shall correspond to the bid period containing the denied training slot award, and each subsequent bid period, except as provided below.</p>
<p>2. A pilot who is denied a training slot, but who is awarded or assigned to another training slot beginning in the same bid period as that in which the denied slot begins, shall be entitled to only one SDP (i.e., SDP does not continue into any subsequent bid periods).</p>
<p>3. A pilot who is denied a training slot award pursuant to <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24D7d" target="_blank">Section 24.D.7.d.</a> (Regulated Age), shall be entitled to SDP in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24E1" target="_blank">Section 24.E.1.</a> The pilot shall continue to receive the applicable SDP through the month in which he starts training, resulting from a subsequent System Bid, in which he was not denied a training slot award due to his regulated age.</p>
<p>4. In subsequent bid period(s), if a pilot (except for a pilot described by <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24E2" target="_blank">Section 24.E.2.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24E3" target="_blank">3</a>.):</p>
<p>a.   does not bid for a training slot to begin ITU training during that bid period(s), and he would have been awarded a training slot, he shall not be entitled to an SDP for that bid period(s); or</p>
<p>b.   is not an Eligible Pilot (for Training/BTA Bid), he shall not be entitled to an SDP for that bid period(s).</p>
<p>5. The SDP shall be paid in the monthly payroll cycle as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_3E1" target="_blank">Section 3.E.1.</a></p>
<p>6. Only one pilot will be eligible for continuous SDP, per training slot. However, there may also be a single SDP associated with that same training slot, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24E2" target="_blank">Section 24.E.2.</a></p>

<p>9. Except as provided in 24.E.3. and 4., SDP shall cease on the earlier of a pilot’s:</p>
<p>a.   training commencement month;</p>
<p>b.   award/assignment to a different crew position than that from which the SDP resulted;</p>
<p>c.   withdrawal from training; or</p>
<p>d.   unavailability for his subsequently awarded training slot.</p>
<p>10.    Repayment of SDP and Inverse SDP, from pilots who do not activate in the crew position for which the SDP or Inverse SDP was paid, shall be exclusively limited to withdrawals from training (other than withdrawals accomplished in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11J2a" target="_blank">Section 11.J.2.a.</a>).</p>
<p>F.   Other Crew Position Award Procedures</p>
<p>1. Down/Lateral Bid Award Restrictions</p>
<p>A pilot may receive a crew position award, based on a down/lateral bid, provided that he:</p>
<p>a.   is bidding to an FDA;</p>
<p>b.   is returning from an FDA after fulfilling his commitment period;</p>
<p>c.   is bidding to a new aircraft within the first 24 months following the closing date of the first System Bid that included awards/assignments in that new aircraft;</p>
<p>d.   can no longer hold his crew status due to legal restrictions; or</p>
<p>e.   has been activated in his current crew status for at least (unless waived by the Vice President, Flight Operations):</p>
<p>i. 24 months, if this will be his first awarded crew position based on a down/lateral bid;</p>
<p>ii.    36 months, if this will be his second or third awarded crew position based on a down/lateral bid;</p>
<p>iii.   60 months, if this will be his fourth or subsequently awarded crew position based on a down/lateral bid.</p>
<p>Note: At the date of implementation of the new System Bid system, pilots will be considered to have zero DLBA awards (i.e., the first DLBA will be measured at the close of the first “new” System Bid).</p>
<p>2. For the purposes of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24F1e" target="_blank">Section 24.F.1.e.</a>, previous down/lateral awards pursuant to <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24F1a" target="_blank">Sections 24.F.1.a.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24FAb" target="_blank">b.</a>, or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24F1d" target="_blank">d.</a> shall not be considered.</p>
<p>3. Bidding Restrictions on Subsequent System Bids</p>
<p>During the time a pilot is in ITU training, the pilot shall not be awarded a crew status that he could have been awarded on the System Bid containing the crew position for which he presently is in training, or on a subsequent System Bid that closed prior to the start of his training.</p>
<p>4. [Reserved]</p>
<p>5. [Reserved]</p>
<p>6. New Hire Crew Positions</p>
<p>a.   As part of the hiring process, the Company may pre-assign initial crew positions for individual new hire pilots who accept an FDA crew position. During his initial new hire training, each pilot not pre-assigned a crew position shall be presented with appropriate information regarding crew positions available for bid. The initial crew position, for a new hire pilot not pre-assigned an initial crew position, shall be determined by his standing bid and seniority.</p>
<p>b.   If the Company hires fewer pilots than are needed to fill all crew positions up to the Minimum Staffing Level, the Company may designate the crew positions to be made available for bidding by only the affected new hire pilots in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24F6a" target="_blank">Section 24.F.6.a.</a></p>
<p>c.   If the Company subsequently hires additional pilots to fill crew positions remaining unfilled from a System Bid, the remaining unfilled crew positions shall first be available for award to the pilots previously hired to fill positions from that System Bid, based upon their seniority and initial standing bid; provided, however, that this paragraph shall not permit a new hire pilot to change his initial crew status.</p>
<p>d.   If, through the application of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24F6c" target="_blank">Section 24.F.6.c.</a>, a junior pilot is activated into a higher paying crew position for which a senior pilot(s) did not have the opportunity to bid, the eligible senior pilot(s) shall be eligible for New Hire Junior Activation Compensation.</p>
<p>e.   If a new hire pilot changes his initial crew position pursuant to <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24F6c" target="_blank">Section 24.F.6.c.</a>, the Company shall activate him at his new base consistent with the Company’s staffing requirements.</p>

<p>a.   be equal to the hourly rate of pay for the crew position in which a junior pilot is activated; and</p>
<p>b.   begin on the date that a junior pilot, from the same or subsequent System Bid, activates into the crew position with the higher hourly rate of pay; and</p>
<p>c.   continue until the earlier of:</p>
<p>i. his activation into a new, subsequently awarded or assigned crew position with a rate of pay the same or higher than his New Hire Junior Activation Compensation;</p>
<p>ii.    his withdrawal or removal from training for a subsequently awarded or assigned crew position with a rate of pay the same or higher than his New Hire Junior Activation Compensation;</p>
<p>iii.   the date he incurs a training cycle failure for a subsequently awarded or assigned crew position with a rate of pay the same or higher than his New Hire Junior Activation Compensation;</p>
<p>iv.    the date as of which all available pilots have completed training (i.e., activated) for his new, subsequently awarded or assigned crew position, from the same System Bid, with a rate of pay the same or higher than his New Hire Junior Activation Compensation;</p>
<p>v. the date as of which there are no longer any junior pilots activated in the crew position that generated his New Hire Junior Activation Compensation eligibility;</p>
<p>vi.    the date the last junior pilot(s) would no longer have been activated in the crew position that generated the pilot’s New Hire Junior Activation Compensation eligibility, but for the junior pilot’s unavailability (e.g., owing to leave of absence, sick leave), if such junior pilot was awarded or assigned another crew position on a subsequent System Bid. That date shall be the date on which the last available, junior pilot is no longer activated in the crew position that generated the Junior Activation Compensation eligibility;</p>
<p>vii.   the date the next most senior available pilot (compared with the junior pilot identified in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24F7cvi" target="_blank">Section 24.F.7.c.vi.)</a> is no longer activated in, or would no longer have been (if the standard in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24F7cvi" target="_blank">Section 24.F.7.c.vi.</a> is applied) activated in, the crew position that generated the New Hire Junior Activation Compensation, if the junior pilot was not awarded a crew position on that subsequent System Bid (e.g., the junior pilot was on leave when the System Bid closed);</p>
<p>viii.  the pilot’s award, on a subsequent System Bid, to another crew position with the same or lower rate of pay than the pilot’s currently awarded crew position; or</p>
<p>ix.    the pilot’s failure to bid, at 100%, a crew position that the pilot could have been awarded, with a rate of pay the same or higher than the New Hire Junior Activation Compensation.</p>
<p>8. Repayment to the Company of New Hire Junior Activation Compensation paid in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24F6d" target="_blank">Section 24.F.6.d.</a>, from pilots who do not activate in the crew position that generated the New Hire Junior Activation Compensation, shall be exclusively limited to situations in which the pilot:</p>
<p>a.   withdrew from training, before or after such training began, for a subsequently awarded or assigned crew position with a rate of pay the same or higher than his New Hire Junior Activation Compensation, other than as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11J2a" target="_blank">Section 11.J.2.a.</a>; or</p>
<p>b.   [Reserved]</p>
<p>c.   in a subsequent System Bid, received an award to a crew position with an hourly rate of pay lower than his currently awarded crew position; or</p>
<p>d.   incurs a training cycle failure.</p>
<p>9. If a pilot entitled to New Hire Junior Activation Compensation in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24F6d" target="_blank">Section 24.F.6.d.</a> requires additional training, his New Hire Junior Activation Compensation shall not accrue during the delay in training caused by his performance.</p>
<p>10.    A pilot who has a legal restriction that prohibits him from flying in his current crew status shall be accommodated in another crew status, if any, from which he is not legally restricted consistent with his seniority and standing bid.</p>
<p>G.   Certain Captain-Qualified Instructor Pilots/Check Airmen</p>
<p>The activation of an Instructor Pilot/Check Airman, who is already qualified in the Captain crew status to which he now holds an actual (non-notional) award, shall be as follows:</p>
<p>1. Such Instructor Pilot/Check Airman shall bid for ITU training slots along with all others awarded/assigned to the crew status;</p>
<p>2. For a bid period in which the Instructor Pilot/Check Airman would have begun training, he will be removed from the ITU training slot, and the Training Bid award will be re-run; and</p>
<p>3. He will then be activated on the first day of the bid period following that bid period in which his training would have begun (pursuant to <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24G2" target="_blank">Section 24.G.2.</a>), had he required it.</p>
<p>H.   Ongoing Implementation Measures</p>
<p>1. The parties recognize that the matters governed by Section 24 are complicated and that this new Section 24 requires significant changes to existing systems and practices. As a result, the parties foresee that flexibility will be required in order to ensure the smoothest possible transition to the new Section 24 rules. To that end, during the Transition Period, measures facilitating the implementation, operation, and/or administration of the provisions in Section 24 may be implemented if agreed upon in writing by the Vice President, Labor Relations and the Association’s MEC Chairman.</p>
<p>2. The Transition Period shall begin on the date the first System Bid conducted pursuant to <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24B" target="_blank">Section 24.B.</a> is posted and shall end 60 days after the second System Bid conducted pursuant to <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_24B" target="_blank">Section 24.B</a>. has been trained to completion. In no event, however, shall the Transition Period be less than 18 months or greater than 30 months in duration.</p>

Remaining reserve days will be made available as reserve blocks, in the View/Add window, and Secondary Working Window (SWW).</p>
<p>5. Days off are local base days scheduled free from duty at a pilot’s base.</p>
<p>6. Trips published in a bid period package that subsequently become available as open time shall remain in the same base during the bid period. Flying not published in a bid period package, including newly constructed trips as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25G5" target="_blank">Section 25.G.5.</a> (certain open time assignments), may be assigned by the Company to any base.</p>
<p>7. A pilot shall be provided access to the Company’s computer systems and data in order to view:</p>
<p>a.   all bid awards and trips;</p>
<p>b.   information related to open time as follows:</p>

<p>(b)  the system(s) is paused to allow manual processing functions; or</p>
<p>(c)  the system(s) affecting open time administration is not running due to system maintenance, upgrades, etc.</p>
<p>ii.    in crew positions for which trip assignment or trading automation is not functioning, trip pairings more than 40.5 hours prior to showtime shall be visible to pilots accessing the open time interface;</p>
<p>iii.   a trip(s) may be frozen to allow assignment by CRS. When a trip is frozen, it will be visible, but displayed in a manner indicating that it is available only to CRS.</p>
<p>c.   the pilot’s own work schedule and pay status;</p>
<p>d.   The instances in which reserve coverage exceeds or meets forecast reserve demand (i.e., “green” or “yellow” status) for the pilot’s crew position, by date, duration, and reserve period (RP);</p>

<p>e.   the current activity or general availability/unavailability status of other reserves.</p>
<p>f.   the assignment of utilized reserves.</p>
<p>g.   special qualifications or restrictions attendant to a particular reserve.</p>
<p>h.   the names of pilots on the reserve list unless the pilot has not opened his schedule to access.</p>
<p>9. [Reserved]</p>
<p>10.    A trip will not be scheduled with any crew composition changes (i.e., basic, or augmented) during any duty period. An operational change of crew composition during a duty period shall not extend a pilot’s block hour or on-duty limitations.</p>
<p>B.   Bid Period Package</p>
<p>1. The Company shall publish (electronically or otherwise, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25B3" target="_blank">Section 25.B.3.</a>) a bid period package for each base and, as necessary, a bid period supplemental package. At least one of these packages shall contain, at a minimum, the following information, current as of the publication date:</p>

<p>p.    Identification of lines in the top 50% of that bid period package’s lines, in terms of scheduled block hours, for the purpose of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25C10a" target="_blank">Section 25.C.10.a.</a></p>
<p>2. The bid period package shall list the following line bidding choices:</p>
<p>a.   Regular lines;</p>
<p>b.   Secondary lines; and</p>
<p>c.   Reserve lines.</p>
<p>3.   Bid period packages shall be published between 23 and 25 days prior to the beginning of the bid period. The bid period package will be published by electronic means only. A limited number of printed bid period packages shall also be distributed and available in bases and the following locations: AFW, CAN, CDG, EWR, OAK and other locations by agreement of the Company and the Association.</p>
<p>4.   If, due to additional pilots activating in a position after the bid period package is distributed but before the bid is awarded, an insufficient number of lines have been published, the required number of secondary lines shall be increased to accommodate the additional pilots.</p>
<p>C.   Bidding Procedures (Monthly)</p>
<p>1. Bid(s) shall be entered through VIPS. If access to VIPS is not available, a pilot may enter his bids by other Company approved means, in writing if possible.</p>
<p>2. A pilot may complete a standing monthly bid in a format designated by the Company. A pilot may update his standing monthly bid at any time. If a pilot does not enter a bid for the bid period, or enters an insufficient number of bid choices, he shall be awarded a line based on his standing monthly bid.</p>
<p>3. If a pilot does not bid, fails to enter a sufficient number of bid choices, and either does not have a standing monthly bid or has a standing monthly bid with an insufficient number of choices, he shall be awarded a line by seniority order, and by numerical order of remaining lines, lowest number first after all pilots entering bids have been processed.</p>
<p>4.   Bidding for Captains shall close 5 days after distribution of the bid period package, unless the bid package is distributed late due to unforeseen circumstances, in which case the Captains’ bids shall close 4 days after distribution of the bid package. In any event, Captains’ bids shall close between 21 and 17 days prior to the commencement of the new bid period. Bidding for First Officer awards shall close 24 hours following the close of the bidding for Captain awards. Bids shall be awarded in order of seniority within each crew position based upon bids received as of 1200 CT on such date.</p>
<p>5.   FAR Experience Bidding Limitations</p>
<p>a.   A First Officer shall not be awarded a regular line which, at the time of bid awards, would result in a violation of the FAR related to experience requirements (FAR 121.434, regarding minimum experience for Captain/First Officer combinations). In such case, the First Officer shall be awarded his next choice for which he is legal.</p>
<p>b.   If any First Officer regular line cannot be awarded through the normal bid award process due to FAR experience requirements, such line shall be assigned to the most junior First Officer who is legal for the assignment.</p>
<p>c.   If a pilot is awarded a regular line that would result in a violation of any FAR related to flight time limitations (e.g., FAR 121.471, 121.483, 121.485, 121.487), and there are multiple trips from which to choose which, if removed, would resolve the FAR conflict, the trip(s) with the lowest CH value shall be dropped as a phase-in conflict.</p>
<p>6. A pilot may only be awarded a line, for flying purposes, for the crew position (i.e., domicile, aircraft, seat) in which he is currently activated and qualified at the time of bid closing. However, a pilot changing domiciles in the same crew status (i.e., aircraft, seat) shall bid and be awarded a line in his new crew position prior to his activation into that new crew position. Such pilot’s activation date shall be the first day of a bid period, or if operating a carryover trip, at the conclusion of such trip. If a pilot is activated but not qualified in his crew position at the time of bid closing, he shall be assigned a custom line as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25I" target="_blank">Section 25.I.</a></p>
<p>7. A pilot in active pay status who is projected to be unavailable for line flying in his current crew position for an entire bid period (e.g., due to training, Association business status or sick leave) shall bid a line for pay only.</p>
<p>a.   A pilot awarded a secondary line in pay only status shall not be eligible for secondary line construction and shall be compensated the average bid period BLG for regular lines for his crew position.</p>
<p>b.   [Reserved]</p>
<p>c.   A bid line shall not be awarded to more than one pay only pilot.</p>
<p>8. If no bid period package is published for a crew position due to the absence of known and confirmed flying in such crew position, pilots holding such crew position shall not be awarded lines for the bid period and shall be paid the average scheduled BLG for regular lines, system-wide.</p>
<p>9. First Officers may submit to be awarded a line with designated Captains. Such submissions shall be accommodated to the extent permitted by this Agreement.</p>
<p>10. Following the first full bid period after activation in which the pilot did not have a custom line, if a non-consolidated pilot is, at bid closing, not projected by the Company to be on-track for timely consolidation (using one projected-accrued block hour per remaining non-extension consolidation day), his monthly schedule awards may be restricted as follows:</p>
<p>a.   awarded a regular line, provided that it includes at least 30 scheduled block hours, or is in the top 50% of lines in that base in terms of scheduled block hours; or</p>
<p>b.   awarded a secondary line, with bidding preferences/priority as determined by the SIG/SLRWG; the pilot may not voluntarily use, toward his secondary line construction, standby trips, reserve blocks, or relief flight officer trips; or</p>
<p>c.   awarded a reserve line, only if he cannot be awarded a regular or secondary line by seniority.</p>
<p>11.    Bid awards shall be available on VIPS by 1700 CT on the date the bid closes. Construction and publication of secondary lines shall be available on VIPS by 1700 LBT not later than 4 days prior to the beginning of the bid period.</p>
<p>12.    Bidding of Recurrent Training</p>
<p>The awarding of a recurrent training session shall be as follows:</p>
<p>a.   A pilot scheduled for recurrent training in the following bid period shall bid for a recurrent training session during the Bid Period Processing Conflict Input Window as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E2" target="_blank">Section 25.E.2.</a></p>
<p>b.   Bids shall be awarded during the Conflict Processing Window as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E3" target="_blank">Section 25.E.3.</a>, and a pilot shall be notified of the award prior to the opening of the View/Add Window as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E4" target="_blank">Section 25.E.4.</a></p>
<p>c.   Recurrent training bids shall be awarded by seniority, provided, however, that a pilot shall not be awarded a recurrent training session in conflict with any other known absence (e.g., vacation period, leave of absence) or carry-out activities from the previous bid period (e.g., carry-out trip or R-days). If a pilot bids a recurrent training session in conflict with a vacation buffer, that buffer will be deemed waived. Conflicts between recurrent training and vacation will be determined based upon the vacation period as awarded, or as adjusted in the Conflict Input Window as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E2b" target="_blank">Section 25.E.2.b.</a></p>
<p>d.   If a pilot cannot be awarded a recurrent training session based on his seniority as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25C12c" target="_blank">Section 25.C.12.c.</a>, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>i. The assignment of his recurrent training shall be done after the award of all recurrent training slots that could be awarded based on seniority.</p>
<p>ii.    The pilot shall be assigned recurrent training avoiding conflicts if possible. If recurrent training must be assigned in conflict with a trip(s) or R-day block (other than a carry-out trip or R-day(s), which will not be conflicted with under this paragraph), those conflicts shall be handled as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25C12f" target="_blank">Section 25.C.12.f.</a></p>
<p>iii.   If it is not possible to assign such pilot to a recurrent training session without conflicting with a known absence (e.g., vacation period, leave of absence, carry-out activities), the following shall apply:</p>
<p>(a)  if the pilot is not in his grace month, then recurrent training will be deferred until the next bid period.</p>
<p>(b)  if the pilot is in his grace month, then upon completion of the bid period processing, the Training Department will coordinate his recurrent training assignment and any conflicts will be handled as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H" target="_blank">Section 25.H.</a></p>
<p>[Application Note: In certain pre and grace month situations, overlaps between calendar months and bid periods may restrict the recurrent training slots for which a pilot is eligible.]</p>
<p>e.   The available sessions for First Officers may be modified (i.e., “rebalanced”), prior to awards based on the sessions awarded to pilots in higher seat positions (e.g., rebalancing of First Officer available sessions will be based on Captains’ awards).</p>
<p>f.   Following the award during the Conflict Processing Window, a trip or block of R-days in conflict with the recurrent training session award shall be treated as a phase-in conflict as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25F" target="_blank">Section 25.F.</a> (e.g., the trip or R-day block shall be dropped and be eligible for make-up under the CIA assignment code), with the pilot having the ability to enter bids during the following View/Add Window. If a recurrent training session award conflicts with any portion of a block of R-days, the entire block shall be dropped as a phase-in conflict and the pilot shall not be responsible for any of the R-days in that block.</p>
<p>D.   Bid Line Categories and Construction</p>
<p>1. Regular Lines</p>
<p>a.   Regular lines shall be constructed solely of trips and days off.</p>
<p>b.   Regular lines shall be constructed with a maximum of 313 hours TAFB in a 4-week bid period, and 390 hours TAFB in a 5-week bid period, and 470 hours TAFB in a 6-week bid period. A single trip in a 6-week bid period shall not exceed 390 TAFB. Regular lines will only be constructed with a maximum of 15 work days in a 4-week bid period, 19 work days in a 5-week bid period, and 23 work days in a 6-week bid period.</p>
<p>c.   Regular lines in a 4-week bid period shall contain at least 1 block of 4 consecutive days off, 1 block of 3 consecutive days off and 1 block of 2 consecutive days off. Blocks of days off may be combined.</p>
<p>d.   Regular lines in a 5-week bid period shall contain at least 1 block of 4 consecutive days off, 2 blocks of 3 consecutive days off and 1 block of 2 consecutive days off. Blocks of days off may be combined.</p>
<p>e.   Regular lines in a 6-week bid period shall contain at least 1 block of 4 consecutive days off, 3 blocks of 3 consecutive days off, and 1 block of 2 consecutive days off. Blocks of days off may be combined.</p>
<p>f.   Regular lines shall be constructed so that the difference between the high BLG and low BLG in a bid period package shall not exceed 13 CH.</p>
<p>2. Secondary Line Construction</p>
<p>a.   A sufficient number of secondary lines shall be published to cover trips and reserve blocks anticipated to be dropped from regular and reserve lines, and other remaining open trips, reserve blocks, and base simulator support events.</p>
<p>b.    Secondary lines shall be constructed in seniority order during the Secondary Working Window (SWW), as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E" target="_blank">Section 25.E.</a></p>
<p>c.   For purposes of secondary line construction, an R-day does not conflict with another scheduled activity if there is at least 12 hours between the reserve period (RP) and the scheduled activity.</p>
<p>d.    Secondary lines may be constructed using trips, base simulator support events (as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25L15" target="_blank">Section 25.L.15.</a>), reserve blocks, or combinations of the three; however:</p>
<p>i. a secondary line containing multiple reserve blocks shall contain at least one day off between them;</p>
<p>ii.    a secondary line containing a reserve block prior to a trip shall contain at least:</p>
<p>(a)  24 hours off (measured from the end of the last RP to the scheduled showtime of the trip), if the pilot preferenced a mixed line that includes a combination of trips and R-days that exceeds 6 consecutive days without a 24 consecutive hour period off; or</p>
<p>(b)  12 hours off (measured from the end of the last RP to the scheduled showtime of the trip), if the pilot did not preference a mixed line that exceeds 6 consecutive days without a 24 consecutive hour period off.</p>
<p>iii.   a secondary line containing a trip prior to a reserve block shall contain at least:</p>
<p>(a)  24 hours off (measured from the end of the trip’s scheduled duty period to the beginning of the first RP), if the pilot preferenced a mixed line that exceeds 6 consecutive days without a 24 consecutive hour period off; or</p>
<p>(b)  12 hours off (measured from the end of the trip’s scheduled duty period to the beginning of the first RP), if the pilot did not preference a mixed line that exceeds 6 consecutive days without a 24 consecutive hour period off.</p>
<p>iv.    A secondary line shall not contain a base simulator support event unless he has preferenced it.</p>
<p>e.   After the close of the View/Add window, and based on remaining open time and reserve blocks, the Company shall publish a high, low, and target secondary line BLG for each crew position. These high/low/target BLGs:</p>
<p>i. Do not apply to trips available in open time for secondary line construction which, by themselves and without regard to carry-in CH, exceed the high secondary line BLG; and</p>
<p>ii.    Shall otherwise conform to the line spread provisions of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4E1d" target="_blank">Section 4.E.1.d.</a></p>
<p>f.   Secondary line construction shall be consistent with the provisions of this Agreement, and the parameters established by the SIG and/or Secondary Line Replacement Working Group (SLRWG).</p>
<p>g.    Carryover CH will not be part of the BLG/RLG for a secondary line except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E4biii" target="_blank">Section 25.E.4.b.iii.</a> If it is not possible to build a secondary line within the line spread without creating a conflict, then the line will be built below the spread. In such case, the difference between that secondary line’s BLG/RLG, and the applicable crew position’s regular line average BLG shall be eligible for Priority Non-Premium (PNP) make-up.</p>
<p>h.   Secondary line construction inputs and preferences shall be entered/updated via VIPS or another secondary line interface, as applicable. If access to VIPS or other interface is not available, a pilot may enter his inputs and preferences by other jointly approved means, in writing if possible.</p>
<p>i.    A pilot may enter standing monthly secondary line preferences, which may be updated at any time. If a secondary line awardee does not enter any specific preferences for the bid period, or enters insufficient preferences, his secondary line shall be constructed respecting secondary line default preferences, as agreed upon by the SIG/SLRWG.</p>
<p>j.    If a pilot enters no preferences, and does not have a standing monthly bid, he shall be awarded a bid period schedule based on the default bid for his crew position.</p>
<p>k.    A secondary line awardee may make other elections, during the first 48 hours of the Secondary Working Window (SWW), as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E6b" target="_blank">Section 25.E.6.b.</a></p>
<p>l.   The Company shall make available a reasons report to help explain each secondary line awardee’s final awarded schedule.</p>
<p>3.   Reserve Line Construction</p>
<p>a.   A reserve line consists entirely of R-days and days off.</p>
<p>b.   In a 4-week bid period, a published reserve line shall contain a maximum of 15 R-days. In a 5-week bid period, a reserve line shall contain a maximum of 19 R-days. In a 6-week bid period, a reserve line shall contain a maximum of 23 R-days.</p>
<p>c.   In the top 90% of published reserve lines, R-days shall be grouped into a block(s) with a minimum of 4 R-days. Other reserve lines shall have block(s) with a minimum of 3 R-days; provided, however, that reserve lines that contain blocks of 3 R-days shall not contain any R-days on weekends.</p>
<p>d.   A published reserve line may be constructed with an additional R-day(s) that carries over into the following bid period.</p>
<p>e.   Among published reserve lines in each bid period package there shall be a minimum of 13% R-24 lines with a minimum of one R-24 line (described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25M2" target="_blank">Section 25.M.2.</a>). The Company and the SIG shall coordinate to establish a percentage of R-24 lines by bid period package, and this percentage shall be reevaluated on a quarterly basis.</p>

<p>g.   Worksheet for reserve vacation line.</p>
<p>3. Conflict Processing Window</p>
<p>The Conflict Processing Window is a period of not less than 24 hours, beginning when the Bid Period Processing Conflict Input Window closes. Within the Conflict Processing Window, recurrent training sessions will be awarded after all other conflicts, except those due to minimum day off protection, have been processed. Following the award of recurrent training sessions, conflicts with recurrent training will then be processed. After recurrent training is awarded, conflicts due to minimum day off protection shall be processed.</p>
<p>4.   View/Add Window</p>
<p>The View/Add Window is a period of not less than 48 hours beginning at the close of the Bid Period Conflict Processing Window.

<p>(b)  Reserve block label; and/or</p>
<p>(c)  Base simulator support event label.</p>
<p>iv.    Bids for MUV and CIA shall be awarded in seniority order. The results of the View/Add Window bids shall be posted no later than 5 hours following the close of the View/Add Window.</p>
<p>b.   Additionally, during the View/Add Window, a secondary line awardee may:</p>
<p>i.    Submit the number of vacation days (i.e., whole 6 CH increments) he desires to apply toward his secondary line, as follows:</p>
<p>(a)  For a pilot who has an awarded vacation period(s) in the upcoming bid period, this number may be:</p>
<p>(1)    as small as zero;</p>
<p>(2)    as large as 12 days, for a 4-week bid period (but at least the number of days in the pilot’s awarded vacation period(s) if larger than 12 days);</p>
<p>(3)    as large as 15 days, for a 5-week bid period (but at least the number of days in the pilot’s awarded vacation period(s) if larger than 15 days); or</p>
<p>(4)   as large as 18 days, for a 6-week bid period (but at least the number of days in the pilot’s awarded vacation period(s) if larger than 18 days).</p>
<p>For the purposes of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E6bib" target="_blank">Section 25.E.6.b.i.(b)</a>, additional vacation days (i.e., “extended” vacation days) are always added to the end of the vacation period as awarded. However, if adding an extended vacation day to the end of the pilot’s awarded vacation period could cause that extended vacation day to either fall beyond the end of the upcoming bid period or touch Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year’s Eve, or New Year’s Day, that extended vacation day will be added to the beginning of the pilot’s awarded vacation period. If adding an extended vacation day to the beginning of the pilot’s awarded vacation period would cause that extended vacation day to either fall into the current bid period or touch Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year’s Eve, or New Year’s Day, the pilot’s submission to add that extended vacation day will not be granted.</p>
<p>(b)  For a pilot who has no awarded vacation period in the upcoming bid period, this number is limited only by his remaining unused vacation credit hours, in 6 CH increments;</p>
<p>ii.    Notify the Company of any known absences (e.g., jury) pending during the upcoming bid period;</p>
<p>iii. Designate the extent to which carryover CH, if any, should apply toward the new bid period’s BLG/RLG, if he is awarded a secondary line; and/or</p>
<p>iv.   Designate the extent to which the CH associated with an awarded recurrent training session should apply toward the new bid period’s BLG/RLG if he is awarded a secondary line.</p>
<p>5.   The View/Add Processing Window is a period of not more than 24 hours (beginning when the View/Add Results are posted) during which time the Company shall process submissions, requests, and designations from secondary line awardees transmitted to the Company pursuant to <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E4b" target="_blank">Section 25.E.4.b.</a> During the View/Add Processing Window, the Company shall:</p>
<p>a. Comply with each submission given staffing in each crew position, which shall be processed in seniority order within the submission type, from secondary line awardees with an awarded vacation period(s) in the upcoming bid period, and who wish to avail themselves of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E4bia" target="_blank">Section 25.E.4.b.i.(a)</a>. In no case shall a submission be approved if it creates a conflict with recurrent training or a known absence (e.g., jury).</p>
<p>b. Comply with each submission given staffing in each crew position, which shall be processed in seniority order within the submission type, from pilots without any awarded vacation periods in the upcoming bid period who wish to avail themselves of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E4bib" target="_blank">Section 25.E.4.b.i.(b).</a> In no case shall a submission be approved if it creates a conflict with recurrent training or a known absence (e.g., jury).</p>
<p>c. Regardless of the given staffing in each crew position, submissions for additional or fewer vacation days shall be honored in seniority order to the extent that they are offsetting.</p>
<p>6. Secondary Working Window (SWW)</p>
<p>The SWW is a period of not less than 144 hours beginning at the posting of the View/Add Processing Window results. During the SWW:</p>
<p>a.   A secondary line awardee may build his secondary line or modify his secondary line preferences;</p>
<p>b.   Additionally, during the first 48 hours of the SWW, a secondary line awardee may:</p>
<p>i. slide his vacation footprint, up to 5 days measured against the greater of:</p>
<p>(a)  his awarded vacation period; or</p>
<p>(b)  his vacation period, as adjusted in the View/Add window;</p>
<p>Provided, however, that no slide may create a conflict with a pilot’s recurrent training or known absence (e.g., jury).</p>
<p>ii.    shrink or eliminate his vacation footprint; and/or</p>
<p>iii.   elect to waive or protect his vacation buffer.</p>
<p>iv.    A vacation period which, as originally awarded, was wholly contained in one bid period may have its footprint, but not its credit hours, slid into an adjacent bid period (except into November or December, or into the current bid period).</p>
<p>v. A pilot’s election to slide, shrink, or eliminate his vacation footprint, in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E6bi" target="_blank">Section 25.E.6.b.i.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E6bii" target="_blank">ii.</a>, has the effect only of enhancing a pilot’s flexibility during the SWW window. That election does not change the credit hour draw against his vacation bank as determined by the View/Add window.</p>
<p>F.   Bid Period Phase-In</p>
<p>1. A phase-in conflict occurs when:</p>
<p>a.   a pilot not qualified for the lowest FAR landing minimums for his aircraft is awarded a trip to an international location that was designated in the bid period package as restricted to pilots qualified to those minimums; or</p>
<p>b.   a pilot is unable to perform an assignment(s) in a bid period due to a trip (including an international buffer, if any) that began in the previous bid period or a carryover R-day(s). For purposes of determining conflicts with R-days on which no activity has been assigned, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>i. An R-day conflicts with an earlier assignment unless there is at least 12 hours prior to the start of the pilot’s first RP, and no legality problems are caused by the previous assignment (e.g., 1-in-7).</p>
<p>ii.    An R-day conflicts with a subsequent assignment unless there are at least 12 hours between the end of the pilot’s R-day and the beginning of the scheduled assignment, and no legality problems are caused by the subsequent assignment (e.g., 1-in-7).</p>
<p>iii.   An R-day conflicts with another R-day unless there are at least 12 hours between the consecutive RPs; however, consecutive R-days with the same RP do not create a conflict.</p>
<p>iv.    The provisions of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25F1bi" target="_blank">Section 25.F.1.b.i.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25$1bii" target="_blank">ii.</a>, and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25F1biii" target="_blank">iii.</a> do not apply operationally or during the application of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25M3d" target="_blank">Section 25.M.3.d.</a></p>
<p>c.   a pilot is awarded/assigned a recurrent training session in conflict with a trip or block of R-days, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25C12dii" target="_blank">Section 25.C.12.d.ii.</a>, or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25C12f" target="_blank">C.12.f.</a></p>
<p>2.   Conflicts relating to on-duty limitations shall be determined based upon scheduled duty limitations, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12C4" target="_blank">Section 12.C.4.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_12D5" target="_blank">D.5.</a></p>
<p>3.   A pilot’s current bid period schedule, inclusive of carryover R-days into the subsequent bid period, shall take precedence over a subsequent bid period award, except as follows:</p>
<p>a.    To avoid a phase-in conflict, a pilot with a trip in the new bid period in excess of 120 hours TAFB shall have the ability to submit to drop a carryover trip or R-day block in the current bid period of less than 72 hours TAFB or 3-day block as follows:</p>
<p>i. Such submission shall be made during the Bid Period Processing Conflict Input Window.</p>
<p>ii.    Any submissions shall be processed in seniority order.</p>
<p>b.   Unpaid carryover on a pilot’s pay only line during ITU shall not create a phase-in conflict in a subsequent bid period.</p>
<p>4. A pilot may elect to waive an international duty free buffer to avoid a phase-in conflict.</p>
<p>5. In the event of a phase-in conflict with a trip(s) on a regular line in the new bid period, the trip(s) in the new bid period shall be dropped without pay and the pilot shall be eligible to make-up the CH value of trip(s) dropped due to phase-in conflict prior to construction of secondary lines, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E4" target="_blank">Section 25.E.4.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25L1" target="_blank">L.1.</a>, and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25L6" target="_blank">L.6.</a></p>
<p>6.   In the event of a phase-in conflict with an R-day(s) in the new bid period:</p>
<p>a.   If other than a vacation conflict, the block containing that R-day(s) in the new bid period shall be dropped and the pilot shall be eligible to make-up an R-day value(s), as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E4" target="_blank">Section 25.E.4.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25L1" target="_blank">L.1.</a>, and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25L6" target="_blank">L.6.</a>;</p>
<p>b.   If a vacation conflict, the entire block containing that R-day(s) in the new bid period shall be made available in open time for the View/Add window; however:</p>
<p>i. The pilot’s vacation bank shall be charged only for the CH value of those R-days in conflict (as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7G3" target="_blank">Section 7.G.3.</a>); and</p>
<p>ii.    Those R-days not in conflict (as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7G3" target="_blank">Section 7.G.3.</a>) shall remain on his schedule, and his vacation bank shall not be charged for their CH value.</p>
<p>7. If a pilot’s line, including recurrent training and carryover from the previous bid period, does not meet minimum days off protection, the following shall apply prior to the construction of secondary lines:</p>
<p>a.   A pilot shall have the ability to drop a trip(s)/R-day(s) from his line, provided that his line, after the adjustment, contains the minimum number of days off and the pilot shall be eligible for make-up. The pilot may request which trip(s) or R-day(s) will be dropped; or</p>
<p>b.   If a pilot is unable to protect his minimum days off as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25F7a" target="_blank">Section 25.F.7.a.</a>, the pilot shall have the ability to drop a trip(s) even though the drop(s) would cause his line to contain more than the minimum number of days off. He may request which trip(s) or R-day(s) will be dropped. The pilot shall then be eligible for make-up to the extent necessary to restore the CH value of a trip(s) dropped in the View/Add Window, prior to construction of secondary lines.</p>
<p>c.   Adjustments to a pilot’s line in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25F7a" target="_blank">Section 25.F.7.a.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25F7b" target="_blank">F.7.b.</a>, shall be made in accordance with Section 25.E.</p>
<p>8. If a pilot’s vacation period ends on the last day of a bid period and is immediately followed on the first day of the subsequent bid period by a block of RP-A or R-24 reserve periods, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>a.   Unless the conflict is waived, the first reserve period will be dropped and eligible for make-up as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E4" target="_blank">Section 25.E.4.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25L1" target="_blank">Section 25.L.1.</a>, and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25L6" target="_blank">L.6.</a></p>
<p>b.   A pilot may waive the vacation/reserve conflict to avoid a phase-in conflict. If waived:</p>
<p>i. an RP-A pilot shall be available for notification pursuant to <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25M3cia" target="_blank">Section 25.M.3.c.i.(a)</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25M3cib" target="_blank">(b)</a>, or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25M3cic" target="_blank">(c)</a>, as appropriate.</p>
<p>ii.    CRS may give an R-24 pilot a reserve assignment via VIPS at least 24 hours prior to its scheduled showtime.</p>
<p>G.   Open Time Assignments</p>
<p>1. Following resolution of phase-in conflicts, open time may be used in the following order: training assignments, phase-in make-up (including MUV, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7G5a" target="_blank">Section 7.G.5.a.</a>), and then substitution/reassignment. Remaining open time shall be used for construction of secondary lines. After construction of secondary lines, open time may be used at any time prior to or during a bid period for PMU, substitution/reassignment, custom line construction, advance reserve assignment, advance volunteer assignment, make-up, training assignment and Association Fly Back (AFB). However, during the first 12 hours after the publication of open time, only pilots shall have access to open time trips starting in the new bid period. The Company may also use open time before the assignment window in order to assign a trip to an R-24 pilot.</p>
<p>2. Open Time Availability</p>
<p>a.    Open time for a bid period shall be available for viewing not later than 72 hours prior to the beginning of the bid period. Each bid period package will indicate when open time will be released. The release times may be staggered between aircraft types and bases to prevent VIPS overload.</p>
<p>b.   A pilot shall be provided access to the Company’s computer systems and data to view information related to available open time as follows:</p>
<p>i. for trip assignment and trading, all open time in the current bid period (and in the next bid period after open time is released) shall be visible in “real time,” except during periods when:</p>
<p>(a)  the daily assignment process is taking place;</p>
<p>(b)  the system(s) is paused to allow manual processing functions; or</p>
<p>(c)  the system(s) affecting open time administration is not running due to system maintenance, upgrades, etc.</p>
<p>ii.    in crew positions for which trip assignment or trading automation is not functioning, trip pairings more than 40.5 hours prior to showtime shall be visible to pilots accessing the open time interface.</p>
<p>iii.   a trip(s) may be frozen to allow assignment by CRS. When a trip is frozen, it will be visible, but displayed in a manner indicating that it is available only to CRS.</p>
<p>3. Assignment Window</p>
<p>a.    Except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25G3ai" target="_blank">Section 25.G.3.a.i.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25G3aii" target="_blank">ii.</a>, at 0900 LBT each day the Company shall begin to assign open time trips and base standbys with showtimes through the next 40.5 hours.</p>
<p>i. At 0700 LBT each day, any trip with 120 hours TAFB or more, with a showtime during the next two local base days that is assigned to a pilot who is on sick leave shall be available in open time for Bid Line Adjustments as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25L" target="_blank">Section 25.L.</a> At 1000 LBT, such trips shall become available for assignment by CRS.</p>
<p>ii.    At 0700 LBT each day, any trip with less than 120 hours TAFB, with a showtime during the next local base day that is assigned to a pilot who is on sick leave shall be available in open time for Bid Line Adjustments as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25L" target="_blank">Section 25.L.</a> At 1000 LBT, such trips shall become available for assignment by CRS, with the exception of trips with a showtime prior to 1800 LBT that same day, which shall become available for assignment by CRS at 0900 LBT.</p>
<p>b.    Open time not assigned as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25G1" target="_blank">Section 25.G.1.</a> shall be assigned in the following order:</p>
<p>i. SUB, RAT, or PMU;</p>
<p>ii.    PNP;</p>
<p>iii.   Make-up:</p>
<p>(a)  CMU</p>
<p>(b)  M/U</p>
<p>(c)  MUS (includes both MUS and MUD)</p>
<p>(d)  MUV</p>
<p>iv.    AFB;</p>
<p>v. RSV;</p>
<p>vi.    VLT;</p>
<p>vii.   DRF.</p>
<p>c.    Notwithstanding <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25G3b" target="_blank">Section 25.G.3.b.</a>, the Company may assign open base airport standbys to reserve pilots prior to any other category.</p>
<p>4. The Company may assign a VLT or DRF ahead of reserve, due to operational requirements, notwithstanding <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25G3" target="_blank">Section 25.G.3.</a> If necessary to prevent or mitigate a departure delay, the Company may make an open time assignment other than as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25G3" target="_blank">Section 25.G.3.</a> and will report the specific circumstances of such assignment(s) to the Association in the bid period report under <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_9B" target="_blank">Section 9.B.</a></p>
<p>5. If an open time trip cannot be assigned through the application of Section 25.G.3.b.i. through v., that trip may be canceled and a new trip(s) may be constructed and assigned according to this paragraph (<a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25G" target="_blank">Section 25.G.</a>). This procedure may only be done inside the open time assignment window, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25G3" target="_blank">Section 25.G.3.</a></p>
<p>H.   Substitution</p>
<p>1. Applicability</p>
<p>Substitution provisions apply only prior to block-out on a trip. Substitution shall not occur due to Company actions made for operational reasons (e.g., trip revision, high minimums pull) after block-out. A pilot who blocks out on a trip, but returns prior to making a landing at another airport, or who never blocks out due to an operational emergency, may be eligible for substitution, as if he had not blocked out.</p>
<p>2. Eligibility for Substitution</p>
<p>A pilot is eligible for substitution if he is removed from a trip for which he is entitled to trip guarantee for any of the reasons listed in this paragraph. Pilots in MUV, MUS, CMU, AFB, VLT, DRF or reserve are not eligible for substitution. If a pilot is removed from a substitution trip for any of the reasons listed in this paragraph, he shall remain eligible for substitution based upon his original trip (i.e., the trip or series of trips that actually created the substitution eligibility). The following events generate substitution eligibility and, where noted, reassignment offers prior to substitution.</p>
<p>a.   Trip Canceled</p>
<p>i. The trip is canceled for any reason; or</p>
<p>ii.    If a trip is canceled due to a change of gauge a pilot shall be offered the rebuilt trip for his aircraft as a SUB or RAT, if possible.</p>
<p>b.   Trip Rescheduled Outside 4 Hour Window</p>
<p>The trip is rescheduled to begin more than 4 hours prior to its original showtime or to terminate more than 4 hours after its original termination time. Trips in this category must be offered to the pilot as a reassignment trip prior to the pilot being placed in substitution.</p>
<p>c.   Showtime Moved Up Without Notice</p>
<p>The trip is rescheduled with a showtime at least 1 hour earlier than the original showtime and the pilot is not adequately notified of that change.For purposes of this paragraph, adequate notification occurs if:</p>
<p>i. the pilot checks in at or prior to the new showtime; or</p>
<p>ii.    he is notified of the change at least 8 hours prior to the new showtime; or</p>
<p>iii.   he is transiting his base on separate trips not interrupted by a legal rest period and he is notified of the change prior to the new showtime.</p>
<p>d.   [Reserved]</p>
<p>e.   [Reserved]</p>
<p>f.   Weather Restrictions</p>
<p> The pilot is removed from the trip due to weather related restrictions.</p>
<p>g.   FAR or Other Governing Authority</p>
<p>The pilot is removed from the trip because he will or is projected to exceed FAR limitations or because of other government controlled restrictions (e.g., work visa not issued in time, revocation or denial of route authority).</p>
<p>h.   Contract Limitations</p>
<p>The pilot is removed from the trip:</p>
<p>i. because he will or is projected to exceed limitations contained in this Agreement (e.g., precautionary weather pull);</p>
<p>ii.    because the Company has determined that he is ineligible to fly based on a general, uniformly applied set of criteria (e.g., lack of LCA on route familiarization segments); or</p>
<p>iii.   due to other circumstances expressly specified in this Agreement as giving rise to substitution eligibility.</p>
<p>i.   Operational Conflict</p>
<p>If a trip is revised more than 24 hours prior to the showtime for that trip, and it causes a conflict with a subsequent trip, the revised trip shall be dropped and eligible for substitution. If a trip is revised within 24 hours of showtime, and the revision causes a conflict with a subsequent trip, the subsequent trip shall be dropped and be eligible for substitution, unless the first trip is eligible for substitution for some additional reason.</p>
<p>j.   Training</p>
<p>The pilot is removed from the trip due to his recurrent training, other than as a phase-in conflict (See <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25F1c" target="_blank">Section 25.F.1.c.</a>).</p>
<p>3. Notification of Substitution Assignment</p>
<p>a.   Notification</p>
<p>A pilot who is eligible for substitution may be offered a substitution assignment at any time. He shall be available to receive substitution offers during the availability periods described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H3b" target="_blank">Section 25.H.3.b.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H3c" target="_blank">c.</a></p>
<p>b.   Initial Availability Period</p>
<p>The initial availability period begins when a pilot is notified of his substitution availability and ends 4 hours after the showtime of his original trip. Beginning 4 hours prior to the showtime of his original trip or once notified of substitution eligibility, whichever is later, he shall be available for substitution assignment until 4 hours after showtime of his original trip. If, before the end of his initial availability period, the pilot has not been offered a substitution assignment (other than airport hold) with a showtime within 72 hours after the showtime of his original trip, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>i. If his substitution window, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H4" target="_blank">Section 25.H.4.</a>, is shorter than 72 hours, he shall have no substitution responsibility after his initial availability period.</p>
<p>ii.    If his substitution window is greater than 72 hours, he shall be credited with 18 hours toward his substitution guarantee. He may not be given a substitution assignment with a showtime within 72 hours of the showtime of his original trip, and he has the following options:</p>
<p>(a)  elect OTP for the balance of his original trip guarantee; or</p>
<p>(b)  remain eligible for substitution.</p>
<p>iii.   A pilot entitled to elect OTP under <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H3bii" target="_blank">Section 25.H.3.b.ii.</a> may do so until the first 0900 LBT after the end of his initial availability period. If the pilot has not elected OTP by that time, he will remain in substitution.</p>
<p>c.   Subsequent Availability Periods For SUB Windows Greater Than 72 Hours</p>
<p>If the pilot chooses to remain eligible for substitution his subsequent availability periods are as follows:</p>
<p>i. A pilot shall be available for substitution assignment between 1000 and 1600 hours LBT the day prior to each remaining day on which he could operate a substitution assignment; however</p>
<p>ii.    He is not required to be available during the last 1000 to 1600 LBT period within his substitution window.</p>
<p>d.    Conflicts With Availability Periods</p>
<p>A pilot shall be required to be available for substitution assignment only during the portion of an availability period during which he is not in a legal rest period, on a trip, or in training. A pilot shall not be considered available if during the entire portion of the IAP, the pilot is in a legal rest period, on a trip, or in training.</p>
<p>e.   Meaning of “Availability”</p>
<p>i. A pilot may supply VIPS with up to four contact numbers, with labels (e.g., “primary,” “cell,” “alternate”) for use during periods when he is required to be available for substitution assignment. In order to contact him during those periods, CRS shall place calls to three (or fewer, when the pilot has listed fewer) of the pilot’s listed phone numbers.</p>
<p>ii.    A pilot shall be deemed “available” for substitution assignment if he either answers calls placed to his contact numbers or returns those calls within 15 minutes. In extenuating circumstances in which a pilot will be out of contact for more than 15 minutes, a pilot may work with CRS to make alternative contact arrangements.</p>
<p>f.   Notification While On Duty</p>
<p>Prior to starting a legal rest period, a pilot on a trip which ends during his substitution window shall contact CRS within 30 minutes following block-in for possible substitution assignment.</p>
<p>g.   Airport Hold</p>
<p>A pilot eligible for substitution may be held at the airport for up to 4 hours after the showtime of the trip for which he was reporting, however, he shall not be held beyond the scheduled duty limitations applicable to that trip. A pilot on airport hold in MEM shall be eligible for a room in the crew rest facility. A pilot on airport hold shall earn 6 CH toward his substitution guarantee, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4L4" target="_blank">Section 4.L.4.</a></p>
<p>4. Substitution Window</p>
<p>A pilot’s substitution window shall be the period beginning 4 hours prior to showtime of the original trip (i.e., the trip or series of trips that actually created the substitution eligibility) and ending 4 hours after the termination of the original trip. For purposes of determining a pilot’s substitution window, a series of trips not interrupted by a legal rest period at base is considered a single trip.</p>
<p>a.   Close of Substitution Window</p>
<p>A pilot’s substitution window shall close if his substitution guarantee exceeds his original trip guarantee.</p>
<p>b.   Recurrent Training</p>
<p>If a pilot becomes eligible for substitution as a result of his recurrent training, any substitution eligibility created will adhere to the provisions of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H3a" target="_blank">Section 25.H.3.a.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H3b" target="_blank">b.</a>, and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H3c" target="_blank">c.</a> (see also <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25C12diiib" target="_blank">Section 25.C.12.d.iii.(b))</a>. His substitution window shall be as follows:</p>
<p>Example: Recurrent training creates substitution eligibility for a 7 day trip, and the pilot is eligible for substitution for 4 days. This shall be treated as if it were a 4 day trip, for purposes of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H3a" target="_blank">Section 25.H.3.a.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H3b" target="_blank">b.</a>, and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H3c" target="_blank">c.</a></p>
<p>i. Training Exclusively On Days Off</p>
<p>If the training is scheduled exclusively on scheduled days off, and as a result of that training, he is scheduled to receive fewer than the minimum days off and has not waived such protection, he shall be removed from a trip(s), and is eligible for substitution on trip days dropped in excess of minimum days off. The Company shall notify him of the contiguous days on which he is eligible for substitution. The pilot shall be responsible for the availability periods corresponding to those days.</p>
<p>ii.    Training Exclusively On Trip Days</p>
<p>If the training is scheduled exclusively on trip days, the pilot shall be eligible for substitution on any trip days dropped not in conflict with training.</p>
<p>iii.   Training On Trip Days And Days Off</p>
<p>If the training is scheduled on trip days and days off, the pilot shall be eligible for substitution for any trip days dropped in excess of the total number of training days (i.e., training days in conflict plus training days not in conflict). If, as a result of the training scheduled under this paragraph, he is scheduled to receive fewer than the minimum days off, and has not waived that protection, he shall be removed from an additional trip(s) and is eligible for substitution on trip days dropped in excess of minimum days off. The Company shall notify him of the contiguous days on which he is eligible for substitution. The pilot shall be responsible for the availability periods corresponding to those days.</p>
<p>iv.    Fewer Than Minimum Days Off Due To Carryover</p>
<p>If the pilot’s line has fewer than the minimum days off as a result of carryover, the number of days off protected shall be limited to the number of scheduled days off on his line (including carryover).</p>
<p>v. Training Rescheduled By Pilot</p>
<p>If the pilot has rescheduled his training from a prior bid period, he shall not be entitled to minimum days off protection. He is eligible for substitution for all trip days dropped not in conflict with training.</p>
<p>vi.    Location of SUB Window</p>
<p>In <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H4bi" target="_blank">Section 25.H.4.b.i.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H4bii" target="_blank">ii.</a>, and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H4biii" target="_blank">iii</a>., when the trip dropped for recurrent training is in actual conflict with the pilot’s recurrent training footprint, the pilot’s substitution window will be scheduled to touch either end of his recurrent training, unless the pilot requests otherwise and an alternative arrangement can be made. If the trip dropped due to recurrent training is not in actual conflict with the training, the SUB window will be based on the footprint of the trip dropped, rather than the recurrent training footprint.</p>
<p>5. Substitution Assignment Parameters</p>
<p>A pilot eligible for substitution may be assigned a substitution trip(s) or standby assignment(s) in accordance with the following:</p>
<p>a.   Substitution Trip Assignment</p>
<p>The showtime and scheduled termination of a substitution trip must be within a pilot’s substitution window.</p>
<p>b.   Daytime Flying Assignment</p>
<p>A pilot eligible for substitution based on a trip in which more than half of the revenue duty periods begin in the day period may be offered any legal substitution assignment; however, if such pilot is offered a trip in which more than half of the revenue duty periods begin outside the day period, he may refuse such trip without loss of trip guarantee.</p>
<p>c.   For a substitution assignment window of 72 hours or less, any assignment shall be sequential or any unassigned periods during this window are eligible to be claimed for reimbursement for a hotel room (not to exceed the base hotel contract rate).</p>
<p>d.   Base Airport Standby Assignment</p>
<p>A pilot may be offered a regularly scheduled base airport standby assignment only if that standby would otherwise have to be assigned to a VLT or DRF pilot. A substitution pilot on standby must accept any standby trip assignment that is scheduled to operate within his substitution window.</p>
<p>Example: The Company may not create a base airport standby solely in order to use a substitution pilot/crew. If, due to operational circumstances, (e.g., weather, anticipated volume), the Company increases the number of standbys (e.g., not 1 pilot on a.m. standby, but 4 pilots on a.m. standby), then the Company could assign the standby to a substitution pilot, as long as it would otherwise have been assigned to a VLT or DRF pilot.</p>
<p>e.   Hotel Standby Request</p>
<p>i. A pilot whose original trip was greater than 72 consecutive hours may request to have a hotel standby pairing constructed to cover his substitution window, or the portion of that window not covered by trips already accepted, if any, in accordance with the following:</p>
<p>(a)  If his substitution eligibility was posted in VIPS, or he was notified of his substitution eligibility by CRS, more than 24 hours prior to showtime, he may request hotel standby through CRS up to 24 hours prior to showtime.</p>
<p>(b)  If he does not have an answer to his hotel standby request or if substitution eligibility was posted in VIPS 24 hours or less prior to showtime, then he may call CRS to request hotel standby. CRS shall grant or deny that request immediately.</p>
<p>ii.    A substitution pilot on hotel standby must accept any standby trip assignment that is scheduled to operate within his substitution window. Normal hotel standby report times apply to a pilot on substitution hotel standby.</p>
<p>f.    Minimum Report Times</p>
<p>Unless waived by the pilot, the earliest showtime for a substitution trip shall be as follows:</p>
<p>i. If a pilot is offered a substitution trip during his initial availability period, and he is not already at the airport, the showtime for that assignment shall be at least the minimum reserve report status applicable to his base, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25M3a" target="_blank">Section 25.M.3.a.</a> (e.g., R-1.5).</p>
<p>ii.    If a pilot is offered a substitution trip during a subsequent availability period (1000 through 1600 LBT), and he is not already at the airport, the showtime for that trip shall be:</p>
<p>(a)  at least 8:00 hours after the first attempt at notification if the first duty period in the trip is scheduled to domestic block hour and on-duty limitations; or</p>
<p>(b)  at least 12:00 hours after the first attempt at notification if the first duty period in the trip is scheduled to international block hour and on-duty limitations.</p>
<p>g.   A pilot shall not be given a substitution assignment that would cause him to be illegal for his next assignment, except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H2i" target="_blank">Section 25.H.2.i.</a></p>
<p>h.   A substitution assignment shall not impinge on a required rest period (including such a rest period associated with training).</p>
<p>6. Acceptance or Rejection of Substitution Assignments</p>
<p>a.    A pilot shall accept or reject a substitution assignment when offered. However, when a pilot learns of a substitution offer through VIPS prior to his initial availability period, he shall have up to 24 hours to accept or reject the assignment, except that no assignment may be rejected within 4 hours of showtime. Failure to reject the assignment in that time frame constitutes acceptance of the assignment.</p>
<p>b.   A pilot shall not earn trip guarantee for his original trip if he:</p>
<p>i. fails to satisfy availability or contact requirements specified in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H3" target="_blank">Section 25.H.3.</a>; or</p>
<p>ii.    trades a substitution assignment; or</p>
<p>iii.   rejects a substitution assignment which is offered by CRS or through VIPS:</p>
<p>(a)  prior to the scheduled showtime of the original trip; or</p>
<p>(b)  during a required contact or availability period; or</p>
<p>(c)  while on Company assignment during his substitution window.</p>
<p>c.   A pilot may reject a substitution assignment offered other than as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H6biii" target="_blank">Section 25.H.6.b.iii.</a>, or in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H5b" target="_blank">Section 25.H.5.b.</a>, without loss of trip guarantee (i.e., night or critical flying offered to day flyer).</p>
<p>Example: A pilot in the second day of a six day substitution window is not offered a substitution assignment during his 1000-1600 LBT availability period. A 3 day trip becomes available and CRS calls the pilot at 1730 to see if the pilot would like the trip as a substitution assignment. The pilot may decline the substitution offer without loss of trip guarantee because the trip was not offered at any of the times described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H6biii" target="_blank">Section 25.H.6.b.iii.</a></p>
<p>d.   A pilot who has forfeited trip guarantee shall have no further substitution eligibility for his original trip, shall not be required to remain available for contact, and shall be eligible for OTP or normal make-up, as applicable. However, if he accepts a substitution assignment(s), but subsequently forfeits trip guarantee, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>i. he shall be responsible for any previously accepted, but not yet operated substitution assignment(s) and that assignment(s) shall be deemed make-up.</p>
<p>ii.    he shall be eligible for make-up for the value of his original trip.</p>
<p>7. Trading or Dropping Substitution Assignments</p>
<p>If a pilot accepts a substitution assignment and then subsequently trades or drops that assignment (including PDO bump by another line pilot), he shall forfeit trip guarantee and be released from future substitution eligibility.</p>
<p>8. Ineligibility for Volunteer</p>
<p>a.   A pilot may not accept a volunteer trip that operates during any portion of his substitution window, except as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H8b" target="_blank">Section 25.H.8.b.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H8c" target="_blank">c.</a>, and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H8d" target="_blank">d.</a></p>
<p>b.   A pilot may accept a VLT trip which is assigned after his last availability period is over.</p>
<p>c.   A pilot who elects OTP at least 4 hours prior to the showtime of his original trip may accept a VLT trip as if he had never been eligible for substitution.</p>
<p>d.   A pilot who elects OTP less than 4 hours prior to showtime, shall not be eligible for a VLT trip with a showtime within 24 hours of the showtime of the original trip.</p>
<p>e.   If a pilot is inadvertently assigned a VLT trip in conflict with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H8" target="_blank">Section 25.H.8.</a> (this paragraph), he shall earn compensation for that trip at 150% of his normal pay rate, or be notified of removal prior to block-out.</p>
<p>9. [Reserved]</p>
<p>10.    Reassignment in Lieu of Substitution</p>
<p>A pilot eligible for substitution may be offered a reassignment trip in lieu of substitution subject to the following:</p>
<p>a.   Reassignment Trip Offer</p>
<p>The Company may offer a reassignment trip to any pilot who has not accepted a substitution assignment.</p>
<p>b.   Acceptance or Rejection of Reassignment Trip Offer</p>
<p>i. If a pilot accepts a reassignment trip he shall earn the higher of trip guarantee for the original trip(s) or trip guarantee for the reassignment trip, calculated as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4M1" target="_blank">Section 4.M.1.</a> (Reassignment Trip Pay). That pilot shall be released from all substitution obligations relating to his original trip.</p>
<p>ii.    If a pilot declines a reassignment trip, he shall remain eligible for substitution.</p>
<p>iii.   If a pilot trades his reassignment trip, he shall earn only the trip guarantee for the trip(s) assumed as a result of the trade.</p>
<p>11.    Election of Open Time Priority In Lieu Of Substitution</p>
<p>a.   A pilot eligible for substitution on a non-PMU trip may elect OTP by notifying CRS via VIPS as follows:</p>
<p>i. any time prior to the showtime of his original trip if he was notified of substitution eligibility prior to showtime; or</p>
<p>ii.    when notified of his substitution eligibility if he is notified after showtime.</p>
<p>b.   If a pilot becomes eligible for substitution on an PMU trip, and rejects SUB, he shall not earn any credit hours for that trip, and shall revert to his original OTP status.</p>
<p>c.   If, while still eligible to elect OTP, a pilot forfeits trip guarantee as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H6" target="_blank">Section 25.H.6.</a>, he shall be placed in OTP automatically.</p>
<p>I.   Custom Lines</p>
<p>1. A custom line shall be comprised of trips, R-days or a combination of trips and R-days. The Company may construct and assign a custom line to a pilot if:</p>
<p>a.   he is returning to line flying in a bid period for which he was ineligible to bid (e.g., returning from a leave of absence); or</p>
<p>b.   he is returning to line flying after having been awarded a pay only line (e.g., completion of OE, extended sick leave); or</p>
<p>c.   he is removed from his line, or a portion thereof, due to anticipated absence and the pilot subsequently becomes available (e.g., training is delayed); or</p>
<p>d.   he is removed from a portion of his line due to conflict with the beginning of ITU training; or</p>
<p>e.   he is a new hire pilot in a bid period for which he was ineligible to bid; or</p>
<p>f.   he becomes qualified after the bid award closed, and as a result, did not receive a line for flying (see <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25C6" target="_blank">Section 25.C.6.</a>).</p>
<p>2. A custom line shall comply with the provisions of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25D1b" target="_blank">Section 25.D.1.b.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25D1f" target="_blank">f.</a></p>
<p>3. The provisions of <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25I2" target="_blank">Section 25.I.2.</a> shall be applied on a prorated basis as follows:</p>
<p>a.   If a pilot is returning to line flying in a bid period for which he was ineligible to bid, the maximum number of credit hours on his custom line shall be a prorated portion of the credit hour value of average BLG for his crew position, based on the number of days remaining in the bid period, rounded to the nearest whole number.</p>
<p>Example:   Average BLG = 74 CH</p>
<p>10 of 28 days remain in bid period</p>
<p>(10÷28) x 74 = Maximum 26 CH on custom line.</p>
<p>b.   The number of credit hours on a custom line for a pilot who has been awarded a pay only line shall not exceed his pay only BLG/RLG, less credit received during the bid period.</p>
<p>i. A pilot returning from training shall be credited an R-day value for each day he receives or shows for scheduled training other than OE, and the higher of SCH or ACH for OE trips. The number of days off on such pilot’s pay only line shall be preserved when constructing his custom line. A day off during his training footprint shall be considered a day off when constructing his custom line.</p>
<p>ii.    The credit hours on a custom line assigned to a pilot returning from sick leave shall be credited to his sick leave account.</p>
<p>c.   A custom line assigned to a pilot who has been awarded a pay only line with carryover may include carryover CH in addition to the maximums established in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25I3a" target="_blank">Section 25.I.3.a.</a> and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25I3b" target="_blank">b.</a>, subject to the following:</p>
<p>i. the number of carryover credit hours on the custom line shall not exceed the credit hours allocated to the carryover portion of a trip on the pilot’s pay only line; and</p>
<p>ii.    the number of carryover R-days on a custom line shall not exceed the number of carryover work days on the pilot’s pay only line.</p>
<p>d.   If a pilot is removed from his line, or a portion thereof, due to anticipated absence and he subsequently becomes available (e.g., training is delayed), the number of credit hours on his custom line shall not exceed the credit hours removed due to his anticipated absence.</p>
<p>e.   The custom line for a pilot who has been removed from a portion of his line due to the beginning of ITU training, shall include a 48 hour duty free period immediately prior to the beginning of ITU training. Any trips on the pilot’s awarded line not in conflict with the pilot’s training or training buffer will be included on his custom line. The number of additional credit hours placed on such pilot’s custom line shall be limited to the following:</p>
<p>Trip(s) CH minus (R-day value times trip days in actual conflict with training) minus 12 CH training buffer.</p>
<p>4. Custom Line Assignment</p>
<p>A pilot eligible for custom line assignment shall contact Crew Resource Planning (CRP) no later than 72 hours prior to the anticipated eligibility for custom line assignment (e.g., return from LOA, OE, or beginning of ITU part of the way through a month). Such pilot shall have the ability to enter a line construction preference worksheet for his custom line at that time. The Company shall accommodate his preferences in accordance with seniority to the greatest extent practicable.</p>
<p>a.   The custom line for a pilot who was in training, shall not be constructed earlier than his completion of training. He shall check VIPS for custom line assignment between 1000 and 1200 LBT after his legal rest period following his final OE trip.</p>
<p>b.   The custom line for a pilot who does not require training shall be constructed within 2 days of his anticipated return to line flying. He shall check VIPS for custom line assignment prior to his anticipated return.</p>
<p>c.   A pilot eligible for custom line assignment shall not submit for any bid line adjustments (<a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25L" target="_blank">Section 25.L.</a>), volunteer, or draft trips for the period covered by his custom line until after he receives such line.</p>
<p>J.   Training Assignment</p>
<p>A pilot whose training requires aircraft line flying (e.g., OE, line check) and who is not currently assigned a trip that provides the required flying, may be assigned a trip(s) as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25G1" target="_blank">Section 25.G.1.</a> (Open Time Assignments). Except during the first twelve hours after the monthly release of open time, instructors may also be assigned trips pursuant to this paragraph for the purpose of conducting training, in accordance with the following:</p>
<p>1. Prior to the end of the first twelve hours of open time release as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25G1" target="_blank">Section 25.G.1.</a> (for the bid period in which the trip in question begins), a trip may not be assigned to a Check Airman if it was on the bid line of a pilot more senior than the Check Airman, prior to becoming open.</p>
<p>2. This seniority restriction does not apply to:</p>
<p>a.   Trips included in the construction of a Check Airman’s secondary line pursuant to <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25D2" target="_blank">Section 25.D.2.</a>; or</p>
<p>b.   Trips assigned beyond the first twelve hours of open time release.</p>
<p>K.   Advance Reserve Assignment</p>
<p>1. The Company may advance assign a reserve pilot in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25G1" target="_blank">Section 25.G.1.</a> (Open Time Assignments) only for the following purposes:</p>
<p>a.    to satisfy FAR experience requirements for the least restrictive operating limitations (e.g., CAT II/III minimums, completion of consolidation requirements, combined crew experience in new equipment, etc.); or</p>
<p>b.   to comply with visa acquisition procedures; or</p>
<p>c.   to cover an open time trip that is more than 60 hours TAFB, in which case such assignment shall not be awarded greater than 7 days in advance; or</p>
<p>d.   to cover an open base simulator support event (as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25L15" target="_blank">Section 25.L.15.</a>), in which case such assignment shall not be awarded prior to the end of the first twelve hours of each bid period’s open time release. Base simulator support events assigned pursuant to this paragraph (<a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25K" target="_blank">Section 25.K.</a>) shall be on the same voluntary only basis (i.e., pass down option available, as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25M6d" target="_blank">Section 25.M.6.d.</a>), and the following shall apply:</p>
<p>i.    an advance reserve assigned base simulator support event shall remain on the reserve pilot’s schedule, with VIPS notification posted, for at least 12 hours before being removed (without leveling credit) for assignment to another pilot, unless Flight Training Scheduling notifies the pilot through other means (e.g., phone call); and</p>
<p>ii.    once notified of an advance reserve assigned base simulator support event, a reserve pilot shall exercise his pass down option within 15 minutes of notification, or else he shall be deemed to have accepted the assignment.</p>
<p>2. A pilot may be advance assigned a trip only if the trip is scheduled to operate on his scheduled R-day(s). At the request of CRS, a pilot may agree to reschedule his R-day(s) so that he can accept an advance reserve assignment.</p>
<p>3. A pilot shall not be removed from an advance reserve assignment except for the reasons stated in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H2a" target="_blank">Section 25.H.2.a.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H2c" target="_blank">H.2.c.</a>, <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H2f" target="_blank">H.2.f.</a> through H.2.j., and <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25M1b" target="_blank">25.M.1.b.</a> Upon notification of removal from an advance reserve assignment, a pilot shall return to reserve status for any of his originally scheduled block of R-days which remain after he was notified of his removal.</p>
<p>4. A trip assigned in advance reserve status is not eligible for bid line adjustments as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25L" target="_blank">Section 25.L.</a>, and is not eligible for substitution.</p>
<p>5. If an advance assignment is made in a future block of R-days, the pilot shall be released from R-days in that future block preceding the showtime of the advance assignment. A reserve pilot who is on R-days when an advance assignment is made shall remain responsible for any R-days remaining in his current block.</p>
<p>6. A pilot shall be credited toward leveling upon assignment as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4H" target="_blank">Section 4.H.</a></p>
<p>7. A pilot given an advance reserve assignment shall not be given another assignment that conflicts with the advance reserve assignment.</p>
<p>L.  Bid Line Adjustments</p>
<p>1. General</p>
<p>a.   A pilot shall have the ability to submit for a bid line adjustment through VIPS at any time during the bid period. Submissions for bid line adjustments shall be processed within each type of adjustment (e.g., PMU, make-up, open time trades, etc.) in the order in which they are received. CRS shall notify a pilot via VIPS that his submission has been accepted or denied and shall be reflected in open time. A pilot shall be responsible for determining whether his submission has been accepted or denied.</p>
<p>The Company shall inform pilots whether, and to what extent, other pilots have already submitted bid line adjustments for a given activity (including the extent of already-submitted priority (PMU or PNP) submissions).</p>
<p>b.    Submissions for open time trips (e.g., PMU, make-up, or trip trade), and submissions to drop a trip shall be submitted no later than 0900 LBT on the day before the first affected activity. Submissions to drop, trade, or move an R-day(s) shall be submitted no later than 0900 LBT on the day before the first affected R-day(s). When submitted later than 0900 LBT on the applicable day, such submission may be processed at the Company’s discretion.</p>
<p>c.   A bid line adjustment that would remove a pilot from a trip scheduled for a check ride is prohibited unless waived by the pilot’s Fleet Captain.</p>
<p>d.    A bid line adjustment is prohibited if it would create a conflict with another scheduled activity (e.g., trip, R-day, training) or if the pilot making such would not be legal to operate another scheduled activity as a result of the bid line adjustment. For purposes of this paragraph, conflicts with R-days shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p>i. An R-day conflicts with an earlier assignment unless there are at least 12 hours prior to the start of the pilot’s first RP, and no legality problems are caused by the previous assignment (e.g., 1-in-7).</p>
<p>ii.    An R-day conflicts with a subsequent assignment unless there are at least 12 hours between the end of the pilot’s R-day and the beginning of the scheduled assignment, and no legality problems are caused by the subsequent assignment (e.g., 1-in-7).</p>
<p>iii.   An R-day conflicts with another R-day unless there are at least 12 hours between the consecutive RPs; however, consecutive R-days with the same RP do not create a conflict.</p>
<p>e.   A pilot shall not submit for an open time assignment that he is not available to operate.</p>
<p>f.   The Company may limit bid line adjustments or other additional flying if it reasonably projects that the flying would cause a pilot to exceed FAR limitations.</p>
<p>g.    The Company shall not deny a pilot’s bid line adjustment on the basis of projected non-currency for landings, provided that the showtime for any trip or standby added as a result of such bid line adjustment is at least 72 hours after the pilot’s projected non-currency.</p>
<p>h.   A pilot may not trade, proffer, or drop a trip assigned as VLT, DRF, AVA, CMU, PDO, or RSV.</p>
<p>i.    A pilot may not be assigned an activity that originates at a base other than his own, except in PDO status.</p>
<p>2. Maximum Allowable Open Time</p>
<p>a.   The Company may deny a pilot’s submission for a bid line adjustment that would place a trip(s) into open time in excess of the Max Open. Max Open is defined as two reserves available for every open trip, as described in the Maximum Open Time LOA; provided, however, that the Company may employ a less restrictive formulation of Max Open in lieu of the formulation described in the Maximum Open Time LOA.</p>
<p>b.   The Company may deny a pilot’s submission for a bid line adjustment that involves the movement or drop of an R-day(s), if such would exceed the forecasted reserve requirement for that date and reserve period as determined by the Reserve Forecast modeling system.</p>
<p>3. Dropping Trips and R-days</p>
<p>a.   A pilot shall have the ability to submit to drop a trip or R-day(s) without pay.</p>
<p>b.   A pilot may not drop a trip or R-day that is scheduled in whole or in part on the following days (i.e., base days): New Year’s Eve, New Year’s Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve or Christmas Day.</p>
<p>c.   A pilot who drops a trip or R-day(s) shall be eligible for make-up.</p>
<p>d.    Contingency Bid Line Adjustment</p>
<p>A pilot shall have the ability to submit a “contingency BLA” whereby the pilot specifies a trip(s) or R-day(s) to drop only if the pilot is able to pick up a specific trip(s). The pilot must have the applicable bank CHs sufficient to cover the trip(s) he submits to pick up. The use of this provision shall be subject to the rules applicable to the bank used by the pilot for the trip(s) picked up.</p>
<p>4. Open Time Priority In Lieu of Substitution (OTP removal code, PMU add code)</p>
<p>A pilot in OTP (as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H11" target="_blank">Section 25.H.11.</a>) may submit for assignment of trips from open time in accordance with the following:</p>
<p>a.   He shall remain in OTP status until the close of the final bid period of pay protection as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4N1" target="_blank">Section 4.N.1.</a> (PMU Trip Pay).</p>
<p>b.   He may submit for a specific trip(s) from available open time, but not for a trip which he rejected as a substitution assignment. The submission shall be processed in the order received among other submissions in OTP status, but ahead of all other open time submissions. This priority is guaranteed only for PMU submissions made prior to 0900 LBT, at least 48 hours prior to the showtime of the identified trip.</p>
<p>c.   He may submit through VIPS for CRS to list him as available on a certain date(s) for PMU make-up assignment. That PMU make-up submission shall be processed in the order received among other make-up submissions in OTP status, but ahead of non-PMU make-up submissions. This priority is guaranteed only for PMU make-up submissions made prior to 0900 LBT on the day before the specific date for which PMU make-up is being submitted.</p>
<p>d.   He is not eligible for a PMU assignment that exceeds his OTP eligibility by more than 6 CH.</p>
<p>e.   If a pilot does not make up all lost credit hours prior to the expiration of his OTP status, the remaining credit hours shall be available for normal make-up.</p>
<p>f.   An OTP pilot’s eligibility for volunteer shall be governed by <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25H8" target="_blank">Section 25.H.8.</a></p>
<p>g.   If a pilot accepts a substitution assignment(s) he is not eligible for OTP.</p>
<p>5.   Priority Non-Premium (PNP)</p>
<p>A pilot shall have the ability to submit for a specific trip(s) or standby(s) from open time (as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25G2" target="_blank">Section 25.G.2.</a>) to make up eligible PNP hours as follows:</p>
<p>a.   He may submit for a specific trip(s) or standby(s) from available open time. The submission shall be processed in the order received among other submissions in PNP status, but ahead of all other open time submissions except PMU. This priority is guaranteed only for PNP submissions made prior to 0900 LBT, at least 48 hours prior to the showtime of the identified trip or standby.</p>
<p>b.   He may submit through VIPS for CRS to list him as available on a certain date(s) for PNP assignment. That PNP submission shall be processed in the order received among other PNP submissions in, but ahead of non-PNP and non-PMU submissions. This priority is guaranteed only for PNP submissions made prior to 0900 LBT on the day before the specific date for which PNP is being submitted.</p>
<p>c.   He is not eligible for a PNP assignment that exceeds his PNP eligibility by more than 6 CH.</p>
<p>6. Make-Up (M/U, CMU, MUS, MUV)</p>
<p>a.   A pilot shall have the ability to submit for a specific trip(s) or standby(s) from open time (as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25G2" target="_blank">Section 25.G.2.</a>) to make up eligible credit hours. These submissions, along with trip trades, will be processed in the order received.</p>
<p>b.   A pilot may submit for an assignment (as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25G2" target="_blank">Section 25.G.2.</a>) to make up eligible credit hours.</p>
<p>i. His submission shall include the date(s) he is available for a trip or base standby.</p>
<p>ii.   His submission may include limitations (e.g., no late call, west coast, weekend layover, no critical duty) or may designate a specific assignment, if available.</p>
<p>iii.   His submission may be withdrawn or modified prior to assignment.</p>
<p>iv.   If a pilot’s make-up submission contains no limitation on the length of assignment, he may be given any make-up assignment that does not conflict with a subsequent assignment on his line.</p>
<p>v. A pilot shall be responsible for any make-up assignment that complies with his submission.</p>
<p>vi.    Unless previously notified of assignment, a pilot shall be available for notification of a make-up assignment beginning 1:30 hours prior to the day on which he is submitting for that assignment or make prior arrangements for notification by mutual agreement with CRS. A pilot submitting for a make-up assignment shall be prepared to show in 1:30 hours unless specified otherwise in his submission. For a base whose shortest reserve report status is other than R-1.5, this paragraph’s requirements shall match accordingly.</p>
<p> Example: In a base with an R-3 reserve report status, a pilot submitting for a make-up assignment shall be prepared to show in 3:00 hours unless specified otherwise in his submission.</p>
<p>vii.   Submissions for make-up shall be processed in the following order: CMU, M/U, MUS, MUV and AFB.</p>
<p>c.   [Reserved]</p>
<p>d.   A make-up assignment shall be operated under a single pay code (e.g., one trip could not be half MUV and half MUS).</p>
<p>e.   A pilot is not eligible for a make-up assignment that exceeds his make-up eligibility by more than 6 CH.</p>
<p>f.   [Reserved]</p>
<p>g.   A pilot entitled to make up an R-day(s) will have an R-day value added to his make-up eligibility for each R-day. He shall make up that R-day(s) in accordance with <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25L6a" target="_blank">Section 25.L.6.a.</a> or <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25L6b" target="_blank">b.</a></p>

<p>Submissions for AFB shall be administered as provided in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25L6" target="_blank">Section 25.L.6.</a></p>
<p>8.   Trading With Open Time</p>
<p>a.   A pilot shall have the ability to submit to trade his trip(s) for another trip(s) in open time. The net effect of any trade(s) in a bid period (including similar footprint trades, as described in <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25L8b" target="_blank">Section 25.L.8.b.</a> may not increase his BLG, as published, by more than 12 CH.</p>
<p>b.   Similar Footprint Trades</p>
<p>If the submission of a bid line adjustment to trade trip(s) or a series of trips would have otherwise been denied due to staffing metrics (e.g., insufficient reserves), such submission shall be accepted if:</p>
<p>i. The trade is submitted no later than 72 hours before the showtime of the trip(s) being placed into open time; and</p>
<p>ii.    The trip(s) in open time has a showtime:</p>
<p>(a)  On the same local base day; and</p>
<p>(b)  In the same reserve period as the original trip(s); and</p>
<p>(c)  An equal to or greater TAFB than the original trip(s); and</p>
<p>iii.   For a series of trips:</p>
<p>(a)  The last trip must end no earlier than 4 hours prior to the end of the original trip(s); and</p>
<p>(b)  The first trip in the series must have a showtime on the same local base day and within the same reserve period.</p>

<p>ii.    Trades between pilots shall be submitted at least 2 hours prior to showtime of the first affected activity. Submissions after 0900 LBT on the day preceding the first affected activity shall be confirmed through VIPS. Submissions within 2 hours of showtime may be processed at the Company’s discretion. Should automatic trip trading become operational, the Company shall process all trip trades submitted at least 1 hour before showtime of the first affected activity.</p>
<p>iii.   A trip trade between pilots may be processed when received, notwithstanding <a href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25L1a" target="_blank">Section 25.L.1.a.</a></p>

<p>b.   Trading Blocks of R-Days</p>
<p>i. A pilot shall have the ability to submit to trade a full block of R-days with another pilot.</p>
<p>ii.    If the submitted trade would combine 2 or more blocks of R-days without an intervening day off on either pilot’s schedule, the approval of that submission shall be at the discretion of CRS.</p>
<p>iii.   R-days assumed by a pilot as a result of a trade(s) shall be considered scheduled R-days for purposes of RLG credit and leveling.</p>

Submissions for PDO bumps shall be submitted at least 2 hours prior to showtime of the affected trip. Submissions after 0900 LBT on the day preceding the affected trip shall be confirmed through VIPS. Submissions within 2 hours of showtime may be processed at the Company’s discretion. A pilot on R-days may submit to bump another pilot to satisfy pilot qualification requirements (e.g., consolidation, currency), and if such submission is approved, the bumped pilot is released and is not responsible for any R-days. A pilot may be bumped from his trip under this paragraph only if he:</p>
<p>i. holds trip guarantee upon assignment for the trip to be bumped;</p>
<p>ii.    holds the trip to be bumped in reserve status; or</p>

<p>v. If the pilot assigned the PDO trip is unable to operate that trip due to illness or injury, the scheduled trip guarantee shall be deducted from his sick leave account.</p>
<p>vi.  [Reserved]</p>
<p>vii.   If a pilot assigned a PDO trip rejects a substitution trip, the credit hours for the PDO trip shall be deducted from his current BLG/RLG and he shall be eligible for make-up.</p>

<p>b. Acquiring a Proffer</p>
<p>i. Provided the submission to acquire a proffer meets all contract and legality parameters, a pilot shall have the ability to acquire a proffered trip in open time:</p>
<p>(a)  To make-up eligible credit hours (M/U, CMU, MUS, MUD, MUV); or</p>
<p>(b)  As a trip pick-up.</p>
<p>ii.    Submissions to acquire a proffer shall be submitted at least 72 hours prior to showtime for the proffered trip, otherwise the proffering pilot shall retain that trip.</p>

<p>g.    A reserve pilot who departs his base to operate a non-augmented duty period shall be scheduled for release to a legal rest period not later than “NW + 16” (i.e., 16 hours after the start of the notification window applicable to his RP). This paragraph shall not apply:</p>
<p>i. to a pilot who is released for a legal rest period prior to the showtime of his reserve assignment;</p>
<p>ii.    if the reserve pilot is assigned to a duty period consisting exclusively of deadhead; or</p>
<p>iii. if the pilot, by virtue of having been timely notified of his next assignment, serves neither his notification window nor any portion of his RP prior to showtime for the departing duty period, and that pilot has at least 8 hours free from duty prior to the next assignment’s showtime.</p>
<p>h.   If a reserve pilot has met or exceeded his RLG, his remaining R-day(s) in the bid period shall be removed without pay consequence.</p>
<p>i.   If a new base is established, the Company shall meet and consult with the Association regarding the feasibility of R-1.5 status in light of reasonable commuting times in the area of the new base, and the possibility of providing hotel rooms for pilots on R-1.5 in case commuting times are especially long or unpredictable.</p>
<p>j.   A reserve pilot released from availability or duty for 24 hours (e.g., 24 hour or greater layover during a trip, released for international buffer, or day off), is assumed to have received a release for 1-in-7. A reserve pilot, during a block of R-days, without an assignment must be notified prior to the beginning of any release that is to satisfy 1-in-7. An R-24 pilot who is released for a 1-in-7 will not be required to be available for notification during his 1-in-7 but will be responsible for an assignment placed in VIPS during that period, provided such assignment is posted at least 24 hours prior to showtime.</p>
<p>k.   Upon release for a legal rest period at base from any assignment, a reserve pilot shall be given a minimum rest period of 10 hours prior to the beginning of any subsequent reserve availability or the showtime of any subsequent assignments.</p>
<p>l.   A reserve pilot shall not be hub turned through his base more than 4 times, during a single block of R-days, without his consent. This provision shall not apply to advance reserve assignments or pilots on first fly.</p>
<p>2. Reserve Periods (RP)</p>
<p>a.   Reserve periods may take any of the following forms:</p>
<p>i. Reserve Period A (RP-A) is a 12 hour period of time beginning at the start of the day.</p>
<p>ii.    Reserve Period A+ (RP-A+) is a 12 hour period of time beginning 6 hours after the start of the day.</p>
<p>iii.   Reserve Period B (RP-B) is a 12 hour period of time beginning 12 hours after the start of the day.</p>
<p>iv.    Reserve Period B+ (RP-B+) is a 12 hour period of time beginning 18 hours after the start of the day.</p>
<p>v. Reserve Period 24 (RP-24) is a 24 hour period of time beginning at the start of the day.</p>
<p>b.   The following shall be published in the bid period package:</p>
<p>i. RP-24 lines (minimum as provided in <a href="#link_25D3e" target="_blank">Section 25.D.3.e.</a>), and at least one of the following:</p>
<p>ii.    Lines of RP-A, RP-A+, RP-B, or RP-B+.</p>
<p>3. Availability</p>
<p>a.   Report Status</p>
<p>Reserve pilots shall have a report status of R-1.5, R-2, R-3 or R-24.</p>
<p>i. Pilots on R-1.5 status must be given at least 1:30 hours’ notice prior to the showtime of any assignment. However, an R-1.5 pilot on a RP-A (or an RP-A+ if an Operational Emergency has been declared under <a href="#link_12A3" target="_blank">Section 12.A.3.</a>) may be given 1 hour notice prior to showtime if there is no airport standby pilot who could be given the assignment, and the pilot is given late call parking. For purposes of this Agreement, the parking lot in the Flight Operations areas in Anchorage is late call parking. Memphis, and any future bases, shall either have designated late call parking or this provision will not apply.</p>
<p>ii.    Pilots on R-2 status must be given at least 2 hours’ notice prior to the showtime of any assignment.</p>
<p>iii.   Pilots on R-3 status must be given at least 3 hours’ notice prior to the showtime of any assignment.</p>
<p>iv.   Pilots on R-1.5, R-2, or R-3 must be given at least 3 hours’ notice prior to the showtime of a base simulator support event assignment.</p>
<p>v. Pilots on R-24 status must be given at least 24 hours’ notice prior to the showtime of any assignment, except:</p>
<p>(a)  an R-24 pilot may be hub turned with less than 24 hours’ notice; and</p>
<p>(b)  if an R-24 pilot is performing an assignment, is on vacation, or has a 48 hour international duty free buffer during his first availability period, CRS may give the pilot a reserve assignment by placing the assignment in VIPS at least 24 hours prior to its scheduled showtime.</p>
<p>vi.    An R-24 pilot shall not have his RP changed to a non R-24 period (Section 25.M.3.d.).</p>
<p>vii. If, due to a shortage of non R-24 pilots, an R-24 pilot is needed in his base for shorter notification, he may be assigned to base hotel standby for a block or a portion of a block of R-days.</p>
<p>(a)  Any assignment to base hotel standby will be for a minimum of two days and a maximum of four consecutive days and shall cover the RP for which there is a shortage.</p>
<p>(b)  The pilot’s originally scheduled R-24 base hotel standby trip may not be revised to include additional base hotel standby periods.</p>
<p>(c)  If the Company assigns a trip to a pilot placed in base hotel standby under this provision, and the trip terminates after the conclusion of the original hotel standby assignment, the pilot shall be deemed to have completed the hotel standby assignment and shall return to his original R-24 schedule.</p>
<p>(d)  Any assignment to base hotel standby shall be made in leveling order, as provided in <a href="#link_25M6" target="_blank">Section 25.M.6.</a> An R-24 pilot shall not be assigned to a base airport standby without first having been assigned to base hotel standby.</p>
<p>b.    Assignment of Report Status</p>
<p>i. The report status for all reserve pilots in a base shall be published in the bid period package. Except for R-24, pilots shall be scheduled for either R-1.5, R-2, or R-3 status for an entire RP block.</p>
<p>ii.    CRS shall notify a reserve pilot of any change in his report status. If a reserve pilot’s report status is changed from R-3 to R-1.5, he shall be provided a minimum of 1:30 hours’ notice of that change and shall be provided a hotel room.</p>
<p>c.   Notification</p>
<p>A pilot shall be available for notification of an assignment throughout his notification window. During his notification window, a pilot shall either answer calls placed by CRS or return those calls within 15 minutes.</p>
<p>i. A pilot’s notification window shall begin:</p>
<p>(a)  1:30 hours prior to his RP for an R-1.5.</p>
<p>(b) 2 hours prior to his RP for an R-2.</p>
<p>(c)  3 hours prior to his RP for an R-3.</p>
<p>(d) 24 hours prior to his RP for an R-24.</p>
<p>ii.    A pilot’s notification window shall end:</p>
<p>(a)  1:30 hours prior to the end of his RP for an R-1.5.</p>
<p>(b) 2 hours prior to the end of his RP for an R-2.</p>
<p>(c) 3 hours prior to the end of his RP for an R-3.</p>
<p>(d)  24 hours prior to the end of his RP for an R-24.</p>
<p>d.   Change of RP Status</p>
<p>CRS may change a pilot’s RP (from or to A, A+, B, B+) consistent with the following. The change of a pilot’s RP shall not interfere with his scheduled days off.</p>
<p>i. CRS may change a pilot’s RP status by providing notice and a duty free period of at least 18 hours, measured from the beginning of the pilot’s original RP or his new RP, whichever is earlier. A pilot may waive the 18 hour required notice.</p>
<p>ii.    From the point of the RP status change, all R-days remaining in that block shall have the same RP.</p>
<p>iii.   If the change of a pilot’s RP conflicts with a scheduled day off, the portion of the RP in conflict with the day off shall be removed with pay. If this occurs, a pilot shall receive 3 CH toward his leveling.</p>
<p>iv.    CRS may assign a reserve pilot 2 trips on consecutive R-days with showtimes in different RPs if the pilot is assigned the second trip at least 18 hours prior to showtime of that trip and:</p>
<p>(a)  the pilot remains on duty between the trips; or</p>
<p>(b)  the pilot has a legal rest period of at least 10 hours between trips and the second trip contains a layover.</p>
<p>v. If a reserve pilot is assigned 2 reserve trips with showtimes in different RPs, his RP for the balance of the block of R-days shall be the RP applicable to the second trip, unless his RP subsequently is changed as provided in <a href="#link_25M3d" target="_blank">Section 25.M.3.d.</a> (this paragraph).</p>
<p>vi.    CRS shall notify a pilot of changes of his RP through VIPS.</p>
<p>vii. If a pilot’s RP is changed, as provided in <a href="#link_25M3d" target="_blank">Section 25.M.3.d.</a>, the pilot shall receive 1:30 CH disruption pay in addition to RLG.</p>
<p>e.   Release Criteria and Provisions</p>
<p>An RP-A, A+, B, or B+ reserve pilot who is given an assignment in his next RP shall be released until the showtime of that assignment. An RP-24 reserve pilot who has been given an assignment shall be released until the showtime of that assignment. If the period between release and showtime is long enough to constitute an FAR legal rest period, that period shall be considered a legal rest period.</p>
<p>f.   Post Duty Availability</p>
<p>A reserve pilot shall contact CRS at the completion of any assignment that terminates within his R-day. Such contact shall be within 30 minutes after block-in if the assignment was a trip or within 30 minutes after the conclusion of any other assignment (e.g., simulator).</p>
<p>i. If a pilot, other than a pilot who has completed a base simulator support event, is not given another assignment for that duty period, he shall be released for a minimum rest period of 10 hours;</p>
<p>ii.    A pilot who has completed a base simulator support event may not be given another assignment for that duty period, and shall be released for a minimum rest period of 12 hours.</p>
<p>g.   Reduced Availability Situations</p>
<p>A reserve pilot shall be available for assignment notification during his notification window, except as follows:</p>
<p>i. CRS may release a reserve pilot for a specified period of time during a reserve period.</p>
<p>ii.    If a reserve pilot has been given an assignment, he is not required to be available prior to showtime for that assignment in the RP in which that assignment is scheduled to begin.</p>
<p>4.   First Fly</p>
<p>A reserve pilot shall have the ability to be assigned trips on a “first fly” basis for an R-day(s) by indicating a first fly election through VIPS no later than 0900 LBT one day prior to the beginning of the first R-day to which first fly will apply. A pilot’s election of first fly shall apply for the purposes of trip assignments only (not to base standbys or base simulator support events, although such pilot may be assigned to those in the normal, non-first fly assignment order). A pilot’s first fly election shall be effective until withdrawn. A pilot may withdraw his first fly election, through VIPS, prior to 0900 LBT one day prior to the effective date of the withdrawal. Any first fly assignments already made shall remain assigned. A separate “first SIM” election shall be available for pilots through VIPS with the same parameters as a “first fly” election.</p>
<p>5. Reserve Leveling</p>
<p>a.   A reserve pilot’s leveling position at the beginning of a bid period shall be zero.</p>
<p>b.   A reserve pilot shall accrue leveling credit as provided in <a href="#section4" target="_blank">Section 4.</a></p>
<p>c.   CRS shall maintain the following reserve assignment lists for each crew position:</p>
<p>i. RP-A</p>
<p>ii.    RP-A+</p>
<p>iii.   RP-B</p>
<p>iv.    RP-B+</p>
<p>v. RP-24</p>
<p>d.   The reserve assignment lists shall be updated, and may be viewed by pilots in VIPS, as provided in <a href="#link_25A7" target="_blank">Section 25.A.7.</a></p>
<p>e.   Reserve assignments shall be made in order of reserve leveling except as provided otherwise in <a href="#link_25K" target="_blank">Section 25.K.</a> (advance reserve assignment) and <a href="#link_25M6" target="_blank">25.M.6.</a> (reserve open time assignments).</p>
<p>f.   A pilot who completes training and has R-day(s) on his custom line shall begin the R-day(s) at zero leveling.</p>
<p>6. Reserve Assignment Options</p>
<p>Reserve assignments shall be made as follows:</p>
<p>a. Trips and base standbys with 60 hours TAFB or less, and base simulator support events shall be assigned in leveling order as follows:</p>
<p>i. The reserve pilot with the lowest leveling position within the RP (and sufficient R-days to perform the assignment) shall be assigned first (i.e., a pilot will not be skipped to optimize the use of another pilot’s reserve days remaining).</p>
<p>ii.    If two or more pilots have the same leveling position, assignments shall be made in reverse seniority order.</p>
<p>iii.   A reserve pilot shall be given the reserve assignment with the highest credit hour value for which he is legal at the time of assignment.</p>
<p>b.   Trips and base standbys in excess of 60 hours TAFB shall be assigned as follows:</p>
<p>i. Among those reserve pilots, in a given RP, whose availability duration (in R-days) most closely matches the duration of the assignment, the reserve pilot with the lowest leveling position shall be assigned first;</p>
<p>ii.    If two or more pilots have the same leveling position, assignments shall be made in inverse seniority order; and</p>
<p>iii.   A reserve pilot shall be given the reserve assignment with the highest credit hour value for which he is legal at the time of assignment.</p>
<p>c.   Notwithstanding <a href="#link_25M6a" target="_blank">Section 25.M.6.a.</a> and <a href="#link_25M6b" target="_blank">b.</a> (leveling order):</p>
<p>i. Reserves who elected the “first fly” option as provided in <a href="#link_25M4" target="_blank">Section 25.M.4.</a> shall be assigned in seniority order, prior to pilots who have not elected that option, until they have accrued 75% of RLG. A “first fly” reserve pilot who has met or exceeded 75% of RLG shall thereafter be assigned without regard to “first fly.” The 75% limitation shall not apply to R-days that are part of a mini-RLG.</p>
<p>ii.    The Company may assign a reserve outside of leveling order to satisfy FAR minimum block hour requirements following training for a new crew position, and pilot proficiency requirements. The pilot shall also have the ability to submit a PDO bump to satisfy such requirements, as provided in <a href="#link_25L11a" target="_blank">Section 25.L.11.a.</a> Such submissions shall be granted if CRS determines that the pilot is not on target to meet proficiency or consolidation requirements and that the trip requested is an appropriate means of addressing that issue.</p>
<p>d.    In the event that a reserve pilot is assigned a base simulator support event (as provided in <a href="#link_25L15" target="_blank">Section 25.L.15.</a>), in normal leveling (non-“first SIM”) order, he may elect to “pass down” that assignment to a pilot lower on the leveling list. If all eligible reserve pilots have elected to “pass down” a base simulator support event, such activity shall not be assigned to a reserve.</p>
<p>e.   No reserve pilot shall be scheduled for more than one base simulator support event in a single duty period.</p>
<p>f.    If a reserve pilot shows for his assignment (other than base simulator support) and is removed, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>i. he may be assigned to another trip, assigned to a base airport standby, or released for a legal rest period.</p>
<p>ii.    If he is assigned a base airport standby, his duty period shall begin at showtime of his original reserve assignment, or the beginning of the base airport standby, whichever is earlier. If he is not given an assignment during the standby period, he shall be released until his next scheduled activity.</p>
<p>g.   If a reserve pilot returns to base from a trip, and does not have another assignment in that duty period, he may either be assigned to another trip that falls within his scheduled duty limits, or released for a legal rest period.</p>
<p>h.    To facilitate reserve assignments, CRS may remove 1 R-day from the beginning or end of a subsequently scheduled block of R-days in the same bid period and add that day to the end of a reserve pilot’s current block of R-days in order to complete a reserve assignment. No more than 1 R-day per line, per bid period, may be moved without a pilot’s approval. A reserve trip must begin on an originally scheduled R-day. A pilot subject to the provisions of this paragraph shall receive 3 CH disruption pay in addition to his RLG. This paragraph shall not apply unless the reserve assignment could not be assigned to an exact availability match, or to a reserve whose availability is one day greater than the assignment’s duration (i.e., “best fit +1”), as provided in <a href="#link_25M6bi" target="_blank">Section 25.M.6.b.i.</a></p>
<p>i.    A reserve pilot may be offered an assignment scheduled to extend beyond the end of his block of R-days. The acceptance of such an assignment is at the pilot’s option. If the pilot accepts the assignment, the portion of the trip that extended beyond his scheduled block of R-days shall be compensated as provided in <a href="#link_4H9" target="_blank">Section 4.H.9.</a> (150% calculated like carryover trip), and the pilot’s responsibility for his remaining R-days on his reserve line shall continue. The Company shall provide a means for a pilot to declare to CRS his willingness to accept such an extension, in local base day increments.</p>
<p>N.   Volunteer (VLT)</p>
<p>1. Volunteer Submissions</p>
<p>A pilot may submit for a VLT assignment through VIPS.</p>
<p>a.   A VLT submission shall include the date(s) the pilot is available for a VLT trip or base standby.</p>
<p>b.    A VLT submission shall have the ability to include limitations (e.g., no late call, west coast, weekend layover, no critical duty periods) or may designate a specific assignment, if available.</p>
<p>c.   A VLT submission may be withdrawn or modified prior to assignment.</p>
<p>d.   A pilot shall be available for notification of a VLT assignment beginning 1:30 hours prior to the day on which he is submitting for a VLT assignment. A pilot submitting for a VLT assignment shall be prepared to show for an assignment in 1:30 hours unless specified otherwise in his VLT submission.</p>
<p>e.   If a pilot’s VLT submission contains no limitation on the length of assignment, he may be given any VLT assignment that does not conflict with a subsequent assignment on his line.</p>
<p>f.   A pilot shall be responsible for any VLT assignment that complies with his VLT submission.</p>
<p>g.   A pilot who holds a pay only line, except a pilot in ITU, may not accept a VLT trip or standby during that bid period.</p>
<p>2. Volunteer Assignment</p>
<p>VLT assignments shall be made during the open time assignment window provided in <a href="#link_25G3" target="_blank">Section 25.G.3.</a> as follows:</p>
<p>a.   VLT submissions prior to 0900 LBT shall be considered before those submitted after 0900 LBT.</p>
<p>b.   VLT assignments shall be made based on the number of VLT credit hours earned in the preceding 180 days. Pilots with the least number of VLT credit hours shall be assigned first. If two or more pilots have earned equal VLT credit hours, the most senior pilot shall be assigned first.</p>
<p>c.   A pilot’s submission for VLT assignment on multiple days shall be effective unless withdrawn by the pilot.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>A pilot submits for VLT on 4 consecutive days, and is assigned a VLT trip on days 1 and 2. The pilot remains eligible for VLT assignment(s) on days 3 and 4 unless he changes his submission.</p>
<p>3. Volunteer Limitations</p>
<p>The following limitations apply to VLT assignments:</p>
<p>a.   A pilot shall not submit for a VLT assignment on a day(s) on which he has dropped a trip, however, he shall have the ability to fly a DRF trip.</p>
<p>b.   A pilot shall not be given a VLT assignment that conflicts with another scheduled activity (e.g., trip, R-day, training, vacation) or that he is not available or legal to operate.</p>
<p>c.   The Company may limit a pilot’s VLT flying if it anticipates that he would exceed FAR or contract limitations for future scheduled duty.</p>
<p>d.   A pilot’s eligibility for a VLT trip that operates during a portion of his substitution window shall be governed by <a href="#link_25H8" target="_blank">Section 25.H.8.</a></p>
<p>e.   [Reserved]</p>
<p>f.   A VLT pilot is not eligible for substitution.</p>
<p>g.   When a VLT assignment is revised prior to block-out and does not meet the pilot’s stated limitations in <a href="#link_25N1a" target="_blank">Section 25.N.1.a.</a> and <a href="#link_25N1b" target="_blank">b.</a>, such VLT pilot shall be removed from the assignment and shall be compensated as provided in <a href="#link_4Q2" target="_blank">Section 4.Q.2.</a></p>
<p>4. Advance Volunteer Assignment (AVA)</p>
<p>The Company may advance assign a VLT trip prior to the open time assignment window subject to the following:</p>
<p>a.   AVA shall be available and assigned to all eligible pilots beginning 7 days prior to showtime for that assignment, based on the reserve forecast.</p>
<p>b.   A trip is eligible for AVA assignment only if the trip has a showtime:</p>
<p>i. between Thanksgiving day and December 31; or</p>
<p>ii. during a bid period in which the Company has requested voluntary vacation cancellations in the pilot’s crew position; or</p>
<p>iii. during a bid period in which the Company has involuntarily canceled a vacation in the pilot’s crew position.</p>
<p>O.   Draft (DRF)</p>
<p>1. CRS shall offer a DRF assignment in reverse seniority order to pilots who are legal and available for that assignment.</p>
<p>2. The first pilot offered a DRF assignment shall be the next pilot senior to the last pilot who accepted a DRF assignment.</p>
<p>3.   A pilot must accept or reject a DRF assignment at the time it is offered, and provided that it has been constructed and is available for viewing in VIPS.</p>
<p>4. A pilot shall have the ability to fly DRF at any time during his time off (including during the time of a dropped trip or refused substitution).</p>
<p>5. A DRF pilot is not eligible for substitution.</p>
<p>6. When a DRF assignment is revised prior to block-out and would otherwise be eligible for substitution, such DRF pilot shall be removed from the assignment and shall be compensated as provided in <a href="#link_4Q2" target="_blank">Section 4.Q.2.</a></p>
<p>P.   Management Assignment</p>
<p>If an open time trip cannot be assigned to a line pilot as provided in <a href="#link_25G" target="_blank">Section 25.G.</a>, except for substitution, that trip may be assigned to a management or supervisory pilot during the period of 9 hours prior to showtime for a domestic trip or 13 hours prior to showtime for an international trip.</p>
<p>Q.   Base Replacement Assignment</p>
<p>1. The Company may remove a pilot from his assigned trip and assign him as a base replacement to another trip when CRS determines that the assignment of that trip as provided in <a href="#link_25G" target="_blank">Section 25.G.</a> would cause a departure delay.</p>
<p>2. When it is necessary to assign a base replacement trip, CRS shall identify the pilots in the applicable crew position who are appropriate for that assignment. If time permits, a base replacement trip shall be offered to those pilots in seniority order. If time does not permit, the assignment may be offered to one or more of those pilots in any order. A pilot may accept or reject a base replacement trip; provided, however, that when necessary, the Company may involuntarily assign that trip.</p>
<p>3. If a pilot’s base replacement trip is canceled, he shall be reassigned to his original trip, if available, and if not, he shall be released.</p>
<p>4. If a reserve pilot is reassigned under the circumstances described in <a href="#link_25Q1" target="_blank">Section 25.Q.1.</a>, he shall not be considered to be on a base replacement trip.</p>
<p>R.   Field Emergency Assignment</p>
<p>1. The Company may offer a field emergency assignment to a pilot not currently on a trip to replace another pilot who is unable to complete his trip in progress, if that pilot cannot be replaced as provided in <a href="#link_25G" target="_blank">Section 25.G.</a></p>
<p>2. A pilot shall accept or reject a field emergency assignment at the time the assignment is offered.</p>
<p>3. A field emergency pilot shall be assigned a trip that is constructed in the following way. The trip shall:</p>
<p>a.   originate at his base;</p>
<p>b.   position the pilot to the aircraft’s location;</p>
<p>c.   operate the required flight(s); and</p>
<p>d.   return to the pilot’s base.</p>
<p>4. A field emergency pilot shall be provided his choice of business jumpseat or an appropriate class of deadhead travel, as provided in <a href="#link_8A3" target="_blank">Section 8.A.3.</a>, to return to his original point of departure at the completion of the trip.</p>
<p>S.   Trip Revision</p>
<p>1. The Company may revise a pilot’s trip at any time in accordance with other provisions of this Agreement.</p>
<p>2.   Trips in the following pay codes are eligible for disruption compensation: TRP, SON, SWP, M/U, MUV, MUD, MUS, PDO, PNP, AFB, and CIA. If a pilot’s eligible trip results in a disruption, the pilot shall receive disruption pay, as provided in <a href="#link_4W" target="_blank">Section 4.W.</a>, in addition to all other compensation for that trip. The pilot must operate the disruption in order to receive the corresponding pay.</p>
<p>a.   Landing Disruption</p>
<p>A disruption(s) is created if a trip is revised such that the number of actual landings during the trip exceeds the number of landings scheduled when the trip was awarded/assigned. Each additional landing shall result in a separate disruption. For purposes of this paragraph, landings are counted if:</p>
<p>i. the pilot was a member of an operating crew during the landing (i.e., not deadheading or jumpseating); and</p>
<p>ii.    the landing did not occur in any of the following circumstances:</p>
<p>(a)  as the result of a diversion due to a maintenance problem on the aircraft the pilot was operating or weather that prevented the pilot from landing at the scheduled destination;</p>
<p>(b)  during a standby sequence;</p>
<p>(c)  during a duty period that was paid as an extra duty period as provided in <a href="#link_4Y" target="_blank">Section 4.Y.</a>;</p>
<p>(d)  as the result of a deadhead at the end of a trip being revised to operate back to base. If this occurs, the first two landings resulting from that change shall not count toward the actual landing total; or</p>
<p>(e)  on a flight identified in the bid period package as a sweep flight. For purposes of this paragraph, no more than 10% of the flights in a particular bid period package (e.g., MD-11 MEM), may be designated as sweep flights.</p>
<p>b.   Duty Period Disruption</p>
<p>A duty period is disrupted if one or more of the following events occurs:</p>
<p>i. a trip was originally scheduled with one layover, and is rescheduled so that the trip has no layover (i.e., trip with one layover rescheduled to an out and back).</p>
<p>ii.    a deadhead at the end of the trip is deleted (i.e., trip revised to operate to base instead of deadhead to base) on a trip that was originally scheduled with revenue flights.</p>
<p>iii.   a standby of any length is added immediately prior to (and in the same duty period as) an originally scheduled deadhead at the beginning or end of a trip.</p>
<p>iv.    a standby period is added to a duty period for reasons other than maintenance or weather (e.g., snow, ice).</p>
<p>c.   Layover Changes</p>
<p>A disruption for a trip occurs if more than half of the layover cities are changed. A layover change is rescheduling a layover to occur in a different city, as determined by the airport identifier, except that the following are not considered changes of a layover city:</p>
<p>i. A change between hotels in the same location; or</p>
<p>ii.    A change between cities that are determined by the SIG to be co-terminal (e.g., MIA, FLL); or</p>
<p>iii.   Cancellation of a layover (e.g., trip with one layover becomes an out and back with no layover (this is a duty period disruption under <a href="#link_25S2bi" target="_blank">Section 25.S.2.b.i.</a>), or a multiple layover trip has fewer layovers due to returning to base early).</p>
<p>The following formula is used for determining layover changes.</p>
<p>Determining whether more than 50% of the layovers have changed (for purposes of <a href="#link_25S" target="_blank">Section 25.S.</a>) will be determined in accordance with the following methodology:</p>
<p>(a)  y = number of scheduled layovers when the pairing was awarded/assigned to the pilot.</p>
<p>(b)  x = number of scheduled layover locations that cannot be paired with actual layover locations (matching location only, not date or time).</p>
<p>(c)  If the trip is shortened, layovers that were scheduled to occur after the actual end of the trip are counted as if they occurred as scheduled.</p>
<p>(d)  Layovers that were scheduled to occur during a standby sequence are counted as if they occurred as scheduled, regardless of how the trip actually operates.</p>
<p>(e)  If x/y &gt; 50%, then a disruption occurs.</p>
<p>d.   Crew Designation Disruption</p>
<p>A crew designation disruption occurs for each flight in which a pilot who was awarded/assigned a designation as a Standard Crew member is reassigned and operates as a Relief Pilot, or vice versa.</p>
<p>e.   Out-and-Back Disruption</p>
<p>An out-and-back disruption occurs when a trip scheduled as an out-and-back (same duty departure and return to base), as awarded/assigned, actually operates as an out-and-back but not to the original outstation(s), as determined by the airport identifier.</p>
<p>f.   Single Layover Disruption</p>
<p>A single layover disruption for a trip occurs if a domestic trip (including a <a href="#link_12D1ci" target="_blank">Section 12.D.1.c.i.</a> or <a href="#link_12D1cii" target="_blank">ii.</a> trip), as awarded/assigned, is scheduled for a single layover but actually operates as a domestic trip with a single layover to a different airport, as determined by the airport identifier.</p>
<p>3. The Company shall make reasonable efforts to return a disrupted pilot to his original trip at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>Example: A hi-mins pull from IND hub turns will be returned at the earliest opportunity to the Captain’s original flight sequence. International point to point flight sequences ordinarily will not be rebuilt, nor will a deadhead be inserted to return a pilot to his original trip</p>
<p>T.   FAR Extensions</p>
<p>If a pilot’s duty period is extended beyond operational limits (as provided in <a href="#link_12C5" target="_blank">Section 12.C.5</a>. or <a href="#link_12D6" target="_blank">12.D.6.</a>), by the Vice President, Flight Operations, or his designee, or the pilot voluntarily extends beyond such limits as provided in <a href="#link_12D6bii" target="_blank">Section 12.D.6.b.ii.</a>, such pilot shall receive FAR extension pay in addition to all other compensation as provided in <a href="#link_4X" target="_blank">Section 4.X.</a> (FAR Extension Pay).</p>
<p>U.   Bumping for Training</p>
<p>1. A pilot may be removed from his trip, or a portion thereof, for required training of another pilot. He shall be notified of his removal as far in advance as possible, but not later than 15 hours prior to showtime. He may waive such minimum notice.</p>
<p>2.   If a pilot is bumped from his entire trip to facilitate the training of another pilot, he shall be removed from the trip, shall have no further responsibility for that trip and shall earn trip guarantee. Any deadhead monies associated with the removed trip shall remain intact. If a pilot is bumped from a trip in a series of trips he shall be entitled to a hotel room as an allowable deviation expense.</p>
<p>3. A pilot may be bumped from a portion of his trip to facilitate the training of another pilot, consistent with the following:</p>
<p>a.   His original trip shall be revised to contain the portion of that trip for which he is still required, based on standard trip construction practices; and</p>
<p>b.   He shall earn trip guarantee for his originally scheduled trip and shall earn per diem and international override, if any, for the revised trip.</p>
<p>Example: If a duty period(s) is normally constructed with an RFO (e.g., duty periods over 7:35 block hours) and a First Officer is bumped to facilitate OE training, the First Officer will be kept on the RFO leg(s), because the student must leave the controls when the LCA leaves the cockpit to rest.</p>
<p>V.  Extra Duty Period</p>
<p>Trips in the following pay codes are eligible for extra duty period pay: TRP, SON, SWP, M/U, MUV, MUD, MUS, PDO, PNP, AFB, and CIA. If the actual number of duty periods operated in a pilot’s eligible trip exceeds the number of duty periods scheduled when the pilot was awarded the trip, the pilot shall be compensated extra duty period pay (3:30 CH at his normal pay rate for each additional duty period), in addition to all other compensation, as provided in <a href="#link_4Y" target="_blank">Section 4.Y.</a></p>
<p>Extra duty periods shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology:</p>
<p>1. Pair scheduled duty periods with actual duty periods based on departure city and final arrival city in that duty period;</p>
<p>2. If all scheduled duty periods can be paired with actual duty periods using <a href="#link_25V1" target="_blank">Section 25.V.1.</a>, then all unpaired duty periods are “extra duty periods;”</p>
<p>3. If all scheduled duty periods cannot be paired with actual duty periods, the unpaired actual duty period with the longest actual duty is the first extra duty period. This process shall continue until the number of actual duty periods remaining equals the number of originally scheduled duty periods.</p>
<p>W.   Special International Bid Award (SIBA) and Special Bid Award (SBA)</p>
<p>1. When regulatory constraints or operational considerations in a foreign location (e.g., availability of entry visas, training considerations) merit the maintenance of a limited number of qualified pilots dedicated to certain specified international flying, the Company may establish a SIBA in the Memphis pilot domicile from which to conduct that flying. When a SBA is established for certain specified flying entirely within the United States, it may only be for the purposes of FRMS study pairings, military charter, or as otherwise agreed to by the Company and the Association’s MEC Chairman.</p>
<p>2. A SIBA/SBA shall be located at the Memphis pilot domicile and shall consist of the specified flying, constructed into regular, secondary, and reserve lines. SIBA/SBA lines of flying shall consist primarily of the specified flying; however, limited amounts of other flying may be used to ensure proper balance in line construction and pay parameters.</p>
<p>3. Pilots bidding for the SIBA/SBA must be current and qualified, have no weather qualification restrictions and hold the crew position in the Memphis pilot domicile designated by the Company for that specified flying. Bid awards to the SIBA/SBA shall be determined in seniority order based on the seniority of the pilots in the Memphis bid pack for the designated aircraft type. If a SIBA/SBA remains unfilled, it may be assigned to the most junior qualified pilot holding the appropriate crew position. An inverse assignment shall be for the duration of the posted SIBA/SBA. A pilot shall not be inversely assigned to a SIBA/SBA more than once in any 14 month period unless all more senior pilots eligible to bid for the SIBA/SBA have also been inversely assigned to the SIBA/SBA. Inverse SIBA/SBA assignments shall not apply to FRMS study pairings.</p>
<p>4. Qualified pilots who are awarded SIBA/SBA shall be obligated to bid and fly in that SIBA/SBA for up to three consecutive bid periods. SIBA/SBA lines shall be awarded in seniority order among pilots in the SIBA/SBA.</p>
<p>5. Any special training required for the SIBA/SBA flying (e.g., ground school, line familiarization) shall be accomplished before or during the first trip of the first bid period associated with that SIBA/SBA, as scheduled by the Company.</p>
<p>6. International override and per diem associated with a SIBA shall be paid in accordance with Sections 3 and 5, and shall accrue on a trip by trip basis.</p>
<p>7. A pilot awarded a SIBA/SBA, who bids on and is awarded or assigned to another crew position, shall be released from his SIBA/SBA award during the bid period(s) in which his training for the new crew position occurs.</p>
<p>X.  Service in the Uniformed Services (Less than 31 Days)</p>
<p>1. The parties recognize that issues regarding the sharing of pilot resources between the Company and the various branches of the uniformed services are important concerns for both the Company and its pilots with service obligations. The parties pledge their mutual cooperation when dealing with periods of service and re-employment issues as they might affect both the Company and its pilots. The Company and Association’s Military Affairs committee shall endeavor to work cooperatively to minimize and resolve issues involving pilots and their service in the uniformed services.</p>
<p>2. The Company shall consult with the Association’s Military Affairs committee prior to publication of Company guidelines concerning short-term periods of service.</p>
<p>3. A pilot whose period of service conflicts with an already scheduled flight activity shall have those activities dropped without pay and eligible for make-up. B-plan contributions shall be made to the pilots for service period conflicts as if those hours were flown by the pilot.</p>
<p>4. A pilot may use available vacation CHs to cover the scheduled CHs in conflict with his service, provided such use does not create a deficit in the pilot’s vacation bank.</p>
<p>5. Contract requirements and guidance pertaining to long-term periods of service (more than 30 days) are found in <a href="#link_13D" target="_blank">Section 13.D.</a></p>
<p>Y. Absence Due to Jury Service</p>
<p>1. When a pilot receives notice pertaining to jury service, he shall notify the Pilot Administration Center (PAC) and provide the Company with a copy of that notice, within 18 calendar days from the original notice of jury service (measured from the date of the jury summons).</p>
<p>2. Failure to provide the PAC with timely notice of jury service and with adequate documentation from the court establishing the beginning and end of his period of jury service shall render the pilot ineligible for pay protection.</p>
<p>3. Jury service will be pay protected as follows:</p>
<p>a.   For jury service in which the pilot’s personal attendance at the courthouse or other juror assembly location is required (“in-person jury service”):</p>
<p>i. The Company shall pay a pilot 100% of the CH value of each scheduled trip or R-day removed as a result of a conflict with the pilot’s period of in-person jury service, which period begins at the time the pilot is required to first attend court and ends upon the pilot’s release from in-person jury service by the court.</p>
<p>ii.    If a pilot is removed from a scheduled multiple day trip in conflict with the pilot’s period of in-person jury service, the pilot shall be eligible for substitution for the portion of the trip not in conflict with in-person jury service. A pilot’s substitution window shall not include the 18 hours immediately preceding or the 8 hours immediately following the pilot’s period of in-person jury service.</p>
<p>iii.   At the pilot’s request, the Company shall drop a scheduled trip(s) that, while not in conflict with the pilot’s period of in-person jury service (as defined above), either:</p>
<p>(a)  ends within 18 hours of the time the pilot is required to first attend court; or</p>
<p>(b)  begins within 18 hours of the time the pilot is released from in-person jury service.</p>
<p>For trips with an SCH of 12 CH or greater, the Company shall pay the pilot 6 CH for each such trip(s), with the remaining CH value of the trip(s) eligible for make-up.</p>
<p>b.   For jury service in which the pilot is required to call the court (or check in with the court through other means) to determine whether the pilot’s personal attendance in the court room will be required in the future (“call-in jury service”):</p>
<p>i. The Company shall pay a pilot 50% of the CH value of each scheduled trip or R-day dropped as a result of a conflict with the period of call-in jury service, which period begins 18 hours prior to the time the pilot would potentially be required to attend court and ends as specified in the jury summons. The CH value of the dropped trip(s) or R-day(s) that is not jury service pay-protected will not be deducted from the pilot’s pay until the paycheck issued on the 15th day of the third ensuing calendar month (e.g., in case of a January bid period trip drop, the pilot’s April 15 paycheck will contain the 50% deduction). In the case of a dropped R-day, 50% of the CH value will be credited to the pilot’s RLG and to his leveling.</p>
<p>ii.    The remaining 50% of the CH value of each scheduled trip or R-day in conflict with the period of call-in jury service (as defined above) shall be eligible for make-up.</p>
<p>c.   Call-in jury service that becomes in-person jury service shall be treated in accordance with <a href="#link_25Y3a" target="_blank">Section 25.Y.3.a.</a></p>
<p>4. When warranted by operational needs, the Company may request the appropriate authorities to defer or establish an alternate date(s) for a pilot’s jury service.</p>
<p>Z.   Bereavement Absence</p>
<p>1. In the event of a death in a pilot’s immediate family (spouse, child, parent, sister, brother, father-in-law, mother-in-law, grandparent, or grandchild, including half and current step relations), the pilot, after notifying the Company of the decedent’s name, address, relationship to the pilot, and date of death, shall receive bereavement absence with pay for a maximum of 3 consecutive days. The 3 days shall begin within 7 days after the date of death. Pay for bereavement absence shall be as provided in <a href="#link_4I8c" target="_blank">Section 4.I.8.c.</a></p>
<p>2. Upon request, a pilot based in an FDA location shall receive an additional two days of bereavement absence without pay for the purpose of travel.</p>
<p>3. A pilot may receive additional days for bereavement absence, with the approval of his Fleet Captain, by using available vacation, or by dropping trip(s)/R-day(s) eligible for make-up.</p>
<p>AA.  Duplicate or Other Assignment Error</p>
<p>1. A duplicate or other assignment error occurs if:</p>
<p>a.   a pilot is inadvertently not given an assignment to which he was entitled; or</p>
<p>b.   a pilot is notified of an assignment, through VIPS or contact with CRS, to which another pilot was entitled; or</p>
<p>c.   multiple pilots are given the same assignment.</p>
<p>2. In case of a duplicate or other assignment error, the following shall apply to the pilot who should have been given the assignment:</p>
<p>a.   If it is feasible, such pilot shall be given the assignment to which he was entitled.</p>
<p>b.   If the assignment is not given to the pilot who should have received it (e.g., time constraints do not permit reassignment), the credit hours from the assignment shall be eligible for compensatory make-up.</p>
<p>c.   If it is not possible to determine which pilot should have received the trip (e.g., time does not permit the necessary research), then the senior pilot shall be offered the choice of performing the assignment, or having the credit hours for the assignment deposited into his compensatory make-up bank.</p>
<p>3. In case of a duplicate or other assignment error, the following shall apply to the pilot, if any, who received the assignment in error.</p>
<p>a.   If operational circumstances permit, such pilot shall be removed from the assignment and it shall be reassigned to the pilot who should have received the assignment, as provided in <a href="#link_25AA2a" target="_blank">Section 25.AA.2.a.</a></p>
<p>b.   If the pilot removed from the trip held trip guarantee for the trip, and received notice of the assignment, through VIPS or contact with CRS, he shall be eligible for compensatory make-up for the credit hours removed due to assignment error.</p>
<p>c.   If the pilot removed from the trip did not hold trip guarantee for the trip, his entitlement to showpay shall be determined in accordance with other provisions of this Agreement.</p>
<p>4. Substitution Election</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above, if, as a result of a duplicate or other assignment error, a pilot is removed from a trip for which he held trip guarantee, or does not receive an assignment for which he would have held trip guarantee upon assignment, the pilot may elect to be placed in substitution in lieu of having credit hours deposited into his compensatory make-up bank. Any such election must be made through direct contact with CRS when the pilot first learns of the error.</p>
<p>5. Limitations</p>
<p>a. <a href="#link_25AA" target="_blank">Section 25.AA.</a> shall not apply to pilots in substitution or reserve status.</p>
<p>b. <a href="#link_25AA" target="_blank">Section 25.AA.</a> shall be applied one time for each qualifying error. If a single assignment error results in several pilots receiving different trips than they would have received but for the error, the provisions of this paragraph only apply to the pilot who received the first trip in error, and the pilot who was denied the first trip due to the error.</p>
<p>6. Compensatory Make-Up</p>
<p>a.   A pilot shall have the ability to submit for a compensatory make-up assignment in the same manner as for regular make-up assignments as provided in <a href="#link_25L6" target="_blank">Section 25.L.6.</a></p>
<p>b.   A pilot is not eligible for a compensatory make-up assignment that exceeds his compensatory make-up eligibility by more than 6 CH.</p>
<p>c.   Compensation for compensatory make-up shall be as provided in <a href="#link_4Q7" target="_blank">Section 4.Q.7.</a></p>
<p>BB.  Scheduling Improvement Group (SIG)</p>
<p>A. Statement of Intent</p>
<p>The parties agree that the construction of the pairings and lines each month can immensely affect both the Company and the pilots. The purpose of the SIG is to provide, through joint participation and cooperation, a process that promotes, to the greatest extent possible, a reasonable balance between the following competing interests of both parties.</p>
<p>1.   For the Company, the efficiency and productivity of the pairings impact operational safety, reliability, cost, and business competitiveness that are critical for proper system and operational coordination. The flight pairing and line construction must be managed and maintained within acceptable financial and operational limits.</p>
<p>2.   For the pilots, flight pairings and lines represent an important factor in their work environment, including the promotion of a safe and effective flight operation. Pairings and lines also contribute, along with seat position, seniority, and work effort to a pilot’s income opportunities. A pilot’s work schedule and the coordination of that work schedule with other flight, travel, and operational responsibilities can impact a pilot’s ability to operate an aircraft safely.</p>
<p>B. Composition of SIG</p>
<p>The SIG shall consist of 4 members. The Company shall select two representatives, one of whom shall be a seniority holding member of Flight Management, and shall designate a SIG Chairman from the two representatives. The Association’s two SIG members shall be the MEC Scheduling Committee Chairman and Vice-Chairman or other line pilots designated by the Association.</p>
<p>C. Responsibilities of the SIG</p>
<p>1.   Oversee Monthly Pairing and Line Construction Process</p>
<p>a. Pairing Construction</p>
<p>The SIG shall ensure that the pairings and lines are constructed, through coordination of the PSIT with CRP specialists. The Crew Planning Department shall build the pairings. The SIG shall have oversight to ensure there is a mutually effective avenue for input into the pairing construction process between the PSIT and CRP Specialists.</p>
<p>i.   Manage Pairing Generation</p>
<p>(a)    The SIG shall work with the Company to produce and develop the parameters that are input into the pairing generator. The Company and the SIG shall work jointly to utilize and manage pairing generation to produce safe, legal and reliable trips that are both flyable in terms of quality of life and cost effective. The Association SIG shall be provided with access to the Company fatigue modeling software for the purposes of evaluating domestic pairings.</p>
<p>(b)    If the Company develops or purchases software including new or different functions for use in pairing generation, the Company shall notify the Association SIG members in writing, at least 45 days prior to using such software in the pairing generation process. The Company shall take input from the Association SIG members regarding the application of such software. The Association SIG members may dispute new functions.</p>
<p>(c)    Upon request by the MEC Scheduling Chairman, the Company shall advise the Association SIG members of significant changes in the settings of existing functions that led to a particular solution.</p>
<p>(d)    Within 30 days of the effective date of the Agreement, the Company shall provide the Association SIG members with a list of each function used in pairing generation and a description of its purpose. Subsequently, this list shall be provided upon request of the MEC Scheduling Chairman.</p>
<p>ii.  Pairings Conference Call</p>
<p> The pairings conference call shall provide the opportunity for PSIT and the Association SIG members’ input of needed repair and design changes. The MEC Scheduling Chairman will designate a lead PSIT member for each base (or at the election of the MEC Scheduling Chairman, each equipment type), who shall be the primary spokesperson for his subgroup on the conference call. The pairings conference call shall include:</p>
<p>(a)    the SIG members, or their designees;</p>
<p>(b)    the participating members of the PSIT and Reviewers, as designated by the MEC Scheduling Committee Chairman; and</p>
<p>(c)    appropriate Company employee(s) involved in pairing and line construction.</p>
<p>iii. Pairing Variety</p>
<p>The Company recognizes that having an assortment of pairing lengths (e.g., 1 day, 2 day, 3 day, 4 day, and longer pairings) facilitates trip trading and provides a variety of choice in regular lines. While pairing solutions inevitably change along with the business, the Company will ensure that, from the perspective of the overall FedEx Flight Operation, there is a selection of trip lengths available for pilots to bid and fly (e.g., some trip lengths may only be available in certain fleets and bases and not others, etc.).</p>
<p>b. Line Construction</p>
<p>The SIG shall manage the PSIT participation in the line construction and dispute process.</p>
<p>c. Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>The SIG shall evaluate both pairings and lines with regard to their impact on safety (e.g., consideration of circadian rhythm disruptions, compounding effects of fatigue, etc.), reliability, reasonable crew desires, and cost effectiveness.</p>
<p>d. Bid Pack Production Timeline</p>
<p>Unless otherwise agreed by the MEC Scheduling Chairman and the SIG Chairman, or unless prevented by circumstances beyond the control of either party, the following timeline shall be observed for the construction of the bid period package. Target dates and “Not Later Than” (NLT) dates are measured from the target date for publication of the bid period package:</p>
<p>i.   The timeline for delivery of the preliminary pairings to the PSIT and reviewers shall be:</p>
<p>(a)    Target: 13 days</p>
<p>(b)    NLT:    11 days</p>
<p>ii.  The timeline for the pairings conference call shall be:</p>
<p>(a)    Target: 8 days</p>
<p>(b)    NLT:    7 days</p>
<p>iii. The timeline for the delivery of the final pairings to the PSIT and reviewers</p>
<p>(a)    Target: 6 days</p>
<p>(b)    NLT:    4 days</p>
<p>iv.   The timeline for the publication of the bid period package shall be:</p>
<p>(a)    Target  Day 0</p>
<p>(b)    NLT Day +1</p>
<p>e. Management of SIG Parameters</p>
<p> The SIG shall work to ensure that the collection of SIG parameters are effective in guiding pairing generation so that the automated solutions further the goals for the SIG process as outlined in <a href="#link_25BBA" target="_blank">Section 25.BB.A.</a> To facilitate this process, there shall be two types of SIG parameters—hard parameters and soft parameters, both of which are applicable in the bid period package construction process.</p>
<p>i.   The Company must apply hard parameters in the bid pack construction process unless the Vice President, Flight Operations and the MEC Chairman agree otherwise in writing. Any such agreement may contain conditions and/or limitations, as mutually agreed between the V.P. and the MEC Chairman.</p>
<p>ii.  The Company may override a soft parameter(s), provided it gives at least 45 days written notice, prior to the delivery of the preliminary pairings, of its intent to do so and the reasons therefore. This notice shall be sent to the MEC Scheduling Chairman. The Association may dispute the Company’s decision via the VP/MEC Chairman track for resolution of disputes as described in <a href="#link_25BBG" target="_blank">Section 25.BB.G.</a> Other soft parameters may be added by agreement of the Association and the Company.</p>
<p>2.   Manage the Pilot Scheduling Improvement Team (PSIT)</p>
<p>a. Composition of PSIT</p>
<p>A primary PSIT member participates directly in the bid period build process and is compensated as such in any given bid period. A back-up PSIT member is a fully trained member assisting the primary(s) in a given bid period through trip review and conference call participation. The roles are rotational and are scheduled by the MEC Scheduling Committee chairman. PSIT members shall be line pilots selected by the Association with the consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.</p>
<p>b. Number of PSIT members</p>
<p>The number of primary PSIT members per base shall be predicated on the crew position with the most lines and on the line count for three consecutive bid periods. There shall be:</p>
<p>i.   1 primary PSIT member if the number of lines is 100 or less;</p>
<p>ii.  2 primary PSIT members if the number of lines is between 101 and 350;</p>
<p>iii. An additional primary PSIT member for each increment of 250 lines (e.g., the third PSIT member is added at 351 lines, the fourth is added at 600 lines, etc.); and</p>
<p>iv.  There shall be one back-up PSIT member for each base, which shall be increased by one for each 300 lines, measured in the same manner as for primary PSIT members.</p>
<p>Example: Suppose there are 280 Captain lines in the Memphis MD-11 base and 320 First Officer lines in that base. The number of back-up PSIT members is 2, since the number of lines is more than 300. When the number of MEM 11 F/O lines reaches 351 for three consecutive bid periods, the number of primary PSIT members assigned to the MEM 11 base shall increase to 3.</p>
<p>c. Duties of PSIT</p>
<p>i.   The PSIT shall report to the SIG and shall perform its duties consistent with the goals outlined for the SIG/PSIT process, as set forth in <a href="#link_25BBA" target="_blank">Section 25.BB.A.</a></p>
<p>ii.  The PSIT shall participate each bid period in the conference call and other joint meetings called to provide constructive input into trip and line construction. Such input shall include, but not be limited to, pilot fatigue issues, weather anomalies, factors which cause variations in actual versus scheduled duty times, air traffic control delays, and other operational considerations related to the flight schedule.</p>
<p>iii. The PSIT shall provide the SIG and flight management with constructive feedback received from line pilots with regard to trips and lines for the purpose of performing the functions within the purview of the SIG/PSIT.</p>
<p>3.   Coordinate Cross Divisional Cooperation in Schedule Construction</p>
<p>a. Scope of Required Coordination</p>
<p>The construction of the monthly flight schedule is influenced by numerous groups within the Company. Promoting the closest practical coordination between the core groups responsible for the final airline schedule is essential to accomplishing the goals stated in <a href="#link_25BBA" target="_blank">Section 25.BB.A.</a> The groups most directly involved in affecting the published flight schedule are: Global Network Planning, Crew Resource Planning, Flight Management, GOC, CRS, Aircraft Acquisitions, Charter Operations, and Flight Safety.</p>
<p>b. Quarterly Cross-Sectional Meeting</p>
<p>i.   To facilitate cooperation between these different areas of the Company which impact pilot schedule construction, and to promote a greater level of mutual understanding, unless otherwise agreed by the MEC Scheduling Chairman and the SIG Chairman, the parties shall meet each calendar quarter with designated representatives from each of the above areas to review, discuss, and share information in an attempt to foster a better understanding of the problems faced by both the Company and the pilots. The SIG Chairman will conduct the meeting. To the greatest extent possible, this group will mutually resolve concerns about flight schedules. At this quarterly meeting, the parties shall also discuss any upcoming changes that are likely to impact the future quarter’s flight schedules, so that problems and disruptions accompanying the changes in constructing future flight schedules can be anticipated and minimized.</p>
<p>ii.  Unless otherwise agreed by the MEC Scheduling Chairman and the SIG Chairman all SIG members shall attend and participate in the quarterly cross sectional meetings and shall work together to recommend jointly to flight management ways in which future schedules can be improved or adjusted. Recommendations to Flight Management shall be in writing and approved by all members of the SIG.</p>
<p>4.   Participate in Development of New Software/Hardware</p>
<p>The SIG shall have regular input into the process of purchasing or developing any new software or hardware that will be used to construct pairings and/or lines. Additionally, if the Company modifies computer systems that pilots use to interface with CRS or CRP (e.g., display of reserve leveling lists, display of open time, input screens, etc.), the SIG shall have input into such modifications.</p>
<p>5.   Communications</p>
<p>General communications to the crew force about the SIG activities and its accomplishments shall be mutually agreed to and jointly reviewed by the Company and the Association before publication, with appropriate consideration for confidentiality.</p>
<p>6.   Provide SIG Input and Feedback on Ancillary Issues</p>
<p>The MEC Scheduling Chairman shall have the ability to provide input into the percentage of credit hours left in open time to facilitate trip trading, and into the process for constructing reserve and secondary lines. The MEC Scheduling Chairman shall also have the ability to provide feedback regarding any revisions or the creation of flying outside the bid period package process.</p>
<p>7.   Staffing Consultation</p>
<p>The Association SIG shall be consulted regarding the staffing for each crew position, for the purposes of <a href="#link_25E5" target="_blank">Section 25.E.5.</a>, and shall be provided that determination monthly with the distribution of the monthly Final Pairings.</p>
<p>8.   Known Reserve Days (<a href="#link_25A4" target="_blank">Section 25.A.4.</a>)</p>
<p>a. Prior to the release of each bid period package, CRP shall provide the Association SIG the following for each crew position:</p>
<p>i.   The planned number of reserve days; and</p>
<p>ii.  RP and block size distributions of those reserve days not built into published reserve lines, which shall be representative of the RP distribution of the published reserve lines.</p>
<p>b. At the beginning of the Build Week (SIG In-Brief), for each crew position, the SIG shall be provided the previous bid period’s actual total reserve coverage (i.e., total reserve coverage after secondary line construction). If the actual total reserve coverage for a crew position exceeds the planned coverage for two consecutive bid periods, the SIG shall adjust the planned number of reserve days accordingly for the following bid period.</p>
<p>D. Access to Information and Confidentiality</p>
<p>1.   Flight Operations Plans and Analysis shall provide all members of the SIG such information in the Company’s possession, as mutually agreed between the Company and the SIG, which is necessary to perform the SIG’s tasks. At a minimum, this information will include the following data in a mutually agreed upon format:</p>
<p>a. A daily report of all trips that exceeded the operational on-duty or block limits, including trip number(s) and the reasons for the extension(s).</p>
<p>b. A bid period report of all trips that exceeded the scheduled on-duty or block limitations, including at a minimum, the trip numbers.</p>
<p>c. A bid period report that identifies trips flown by number, frequency of occurrence, CH value and assignment code. This information shall be available only on Company property unless otherwise agreed by the Vice President, Flight Operations or his designee.</p>
<p>d. Sick leave utilization by crew position, for each bid period.</p>
<p>e. Reserve utilization by reserve period type, by crew position, for each bid period.</p>
<p>f. Volunteer and Draft incidence by crew position, for each bid period.</p>
<p>g. Actual block hours by crew position, for each bid period.</p>
<p>h. Actual credit hours by crew position, for each bid period.</p>
<p>i. Block hour distribution by crew position, for each bid period.</p>
<p>j.    All revisions of specific trips, made viewable by Association SIG members.</p>
<p>k.  A report, by occurrence, detailing the reason for and the frequency of business necessity deadheads on a Company aircraft, chartered jet carrier, Company corporate business jet aircraft or on a scheduled U.S. certificated air carrier operating under FAR Part 135. All members of the SIG shall be notified of the reasons for any action by the end of the next business day.</p>
<p>2.   The SIG, PSIT, and reviewers recognize that they may be entrusted with information not generally made available to line pilots, or to the public, that constitutes confidential information, in which the Company has a significant and valuable proprietary interest. This information shall be kept confidential and shall not be published nor shall it be distributed outside the Company to any third party for any purpose, without the express written permission of the V.P. of Flight, nor shall it be used for any purpose other than to meet SIG responsibilities outlined in this Section.</p>
<p>E. Initial Resolution of Scheduling Disputes – System Chief Pilot and Fatigue Risk Management Group (FRMG) Tracks</p>
<p>The SIG may formally dispute particular pairings in accordance with the following processes that are inconsistent with the goals and purposes established elsewhere in this Agreement, the Company’s Fatigue Risk Management Plan (FRMP), and/or the Fatigue Risk Management System (FRMS) (as administered by the Company’s FRMG). In no case shall disputes made under the provisions of this Section cause a delay in the publication of the monthly bid package.</p>
<p>Intent: The language regarding not creating a delay in bid pack publication is not meant to allow a “fix it next month” mentality. The process is intended to be as expedited as possible, but it will not be permitted to jeopardize the timely publication of bid packs.</p>
<p>1.   The SIG may use the pairing dispute procedures described in this paragraph only to dispute new pairings. A “new” pairing is one which is materially different from the way the pairing was constructed in the three previous bid periods. A pairing is not new if it has been built and flown materially the same way without challenge for three consecutive bid periods after 5/31/1999. A change in a deadhead carrier or service provider (e.g., change from Delta to United or from Super Shuttle to Argenbright) shall not, by itself, constitute a material change unless such deadhead change eliminates a layover or occurs mid-pairing.</p>
<p>2.   The SIG shall provide a written list of all disputed pairings prior to the monthly conference call/meeting and shall identify each disputed pairing and the reasons why it is unacceptable during that conference call. The Company may agree to rebuild the pairing to alleviate the concerns expressed by the SIG. The SIG may withdraw a dispute after discussion during the conference call/meeting. If, between the pairings conference call and the issuance of the final pairings, a new pairing design is built for inclusion in the bid period package, the SIG shall have the ability to dispute such new design as if it had been part of the preliminary pairing solution.</p>
<p> Intent: Disputed pairings shall be corrected in the current month to the maximum extent possible without delaying the process.</p>
<p>3.   If there are pairings that remain disputed after the conference call/meeting, the SIG shall meet and attempt to resolve the pairings still in dispute. If all such disputes are not resolved by the SIG, the SIG shall select the appropriate dispute resolution track (i.e., System Chief Pilot track or FRMG track) based on the underlying rationale of the dispute.</p>
<p>4.   System Chief Pilot Track</p>
<p>a. The SIG shall present the System Chief Pilot (SCP), or his designee, with the written rationale explaining why each pairing should be changed.</p>
<p>b. The SCP or his designee shall review each disputed pairing and may direct that the pairing be rebuilt to the SIG’s satisfaction. The SIG may withdraw the dispute after the meeting with the SCP or his designee.</p>
<p>c. If there are pairings that remain disputed after meeting with the SCP, or his designee, the following process shall apply to each bid period package which contains disputed pairings for the immediately upcoming bid period only:</p>
<p>i.   If the number of remaining disputed pairings in a particular bid period package does not exceed 5% of the total number of pairings in that bid period package, the disputed pairings shall not be included on bid lines without SIG approval. Such pairings shall appear in open time and shall be available for ordinary open time assignment, or for placement on a secondary or custom line if specifically requested by a pilot holding such line.</p>
<p>ii.  If the number of remaining disputed pairings in a particular bid period package exceeds 5% of the total number of pairings in that bid period package, the SIG shall choose the pairings which shall be placed in open time as described in <a href="#link_25BBE4ci" target="_blank">Section 25.BB.E.4.c.i.</a> (i.e., up to 5% of the total number of pairings in the bid period package). The remaining disputed pairings may be built into bid lines.</p>
<p>iii. When calculating the 5% referenced in <a href="#link_25BBE4ci" target="_blank">Sections 25.BB.E.4.c.i.</a> and <a href="#link_25BB4cii" target="_blank">ii.</a>, a bid period package with pairings that are not identical in all seat positions shall be treated as separate bid period packages for each seat position. If a particular flight sequence which is the cause of a dispute appears in several pairings, those pairings shall count as one pairing for purposes of the 5%.</p>
<p>5.   FRMG Track (Fatigue-Related Disputes Only)</p>
<p>a. If the only underlying rationale for the dispute is based on a fatigue-related concern, the dispute must follow the FRMG track.</p>
<p>b. The SIG shall transmit to the FERC the written rationale explaining why each pairing should be changed.</p>
<p>c. The FERC shall analyze the pairing for its impact on pilot alertness. At a minimum this will include the fatigue model output of the Company and Association’s fatigue modeling software.</p>
<p>i.   The FERC shall attempt to reach consensus on a recommendation to:</p>
<p>(a)    Have the pairing rebuilt; or</p>
<p>(b)    Perform data collection on the pairing.</p>
<p>ii.  In the absence of consensus the pairing will immediately be referred to the DCSC for evaluation. The DCSC shall make a recommendation to:</p>
<p>(a)    Have the pairing rebuilt; or</p>
<p>(b)    Perform data collection on the pairing.</p>
<p>iii. In the absence of DCSC consensus, the pairing shall be referred to the dispute track chosen by the Association MEC Scheduling Chairman.</p>
<p>d. Should the FERC’s/DCSC’s recommendation be to perform data collection, then:</p>
<p>i.   All fatigue report data gathered on the pairing shall be promptly reviewed and analyzed by the Fatigue Event Review Committee (FERC) and transmitted to the FRMG for review and consideration;</p>
<p>ii. The pairing shall be included in the Data Collection Steering Committee’s human performance/alertness data collection and analysis efforts;</p>
<p>iii. The parties may solicit feedback from pilots operating the pairing only by operation of the Collection of Human Performance/Alertness Data MOU, the Company’s FRMP, or <a href="#link_12A9" target="_blank">Section 12.A.9.</a>; and</p>
<p>iv.  The pairing shall be studied as a Category 3 pairing as defined in <a href="#link_12A10" target="_blank">Section 12.A.10.</a></p>
<p>[Note: Both parties agree not to intentionally characterize such pairings in a way that compromises the scientific validity of data gathered on such pairings until the dispute is finally resolved.]</p>
<p>e. At its next regularly scheduled meeting, the FRMG shall review the pairing presented to it by the SIG (including the underlying rationale for the dispute), the data and analysis of the FERC (if any) on the pairing, and the human performance/alertness data collected from pilots operating the pairing since initiation of the FRMG track. To the extent that preliminary or final analyses of those human performance/alertness data are available, those analyses shall also be presented to the FRMG. The SIG may withdraw the dispute after presentation to the FRMG.</p>
<p>f. During the FRMG’s review of the pairing, the FRMG’s focus shall be on whether the pairing under review is consistent with the goals of the Company’s FRMP and/or FRMS and shall consider only whether the pairing under review is constructed with appropriate consideration of cumulative and transient fatigue. After completing its review, the FRMG may either:</p>
<p>i.   Approve the pairing as designed by the Company;</p>
<p>ii.  Direct that the pairing be rebuilt; or</p>
<p>iii. Conduct an enhanced review of the pairing.</p>
<p>g. If the FRMG decides to conduct an enhanced review of the pairing, the enhanced review period (ERP) shall be 3 bid periods in duration. The FRMG may consider revision of the pairing at any time during the ERP. At the end of the ERP, the FRMG may extend the ERP up to an additional 3 bid periods.</p>
<p>h. In addition to any human performance/alertness data and fatigue report data gathered from pilots operating the pairing during the FRMG’s review, the FRMG shall also consider the manner in which the pairing is assigned (e.g., BLA, reserve, standby, etc.), the relative seniority of pilots assigned to the pairing, the turnover of each pairing (e.g., dropped, sick, etc.), and the operational history of the pairing (e.g., operational revisions, extensions, etc.).</p>
<p>i. During the FRMG review process, the members of the FRMG shall attempt to reach consensus. If the members of the FRMG reach consensus, that decision shall be final. If the members of the FRMG are unable to reach consensus on an issue, the matter shall be jointly presented to the Vice President, Flight Operations within 5 business days of the FRMG meeting. The Vice President shall render a written decision within 5 business days of the presentation of the matter. The Vice President shall send copies of the decision to the members of the FRMG. If the Association disagrees with the decision, it may appeal the matter to the Senior Vice President of Flight Operations, whose decision shall be final.</p>
<p>6.   If a pairing routinely goes into operational limits that pairing shall be rebuilt.</p>
<p>7.   If the Association SIG members elect to pursue the dispute further they shall choose between the mutually exclusive processes described in <a href="#link_25BBF" target="_blank">Section 25.BB.F.</a> and <a href="#link_25BBG" target="_blank">G.</a> If the Association SIG members do not choose a dispute track after having disputed a pairing for four bid periods, the SIG Chairman may initiate the SIG Neutral track.</p>
<p>F. Final Resolution of Scheduling Disputes: SIG Neutral Track</p>
<p>If the Association SIG members elect to pursue the SIG neutral track, the following procedure shall apply.</p>
<p>1.   Upon written request by the chairman of the SIG, the SCP shall convene a Scheduling Dispute Board. The board shall be composed of the SCP, the MEC Chairman, one Company SIG representative and one Association SIG representative.</p>
<p>a. The board shall meet within 5 calendar days to review appropriate data, including the flying history of the disputed pairing(s), at issue and discuss reasonable options on how the disputed pairing can be reconfigured in light of the operational requirements. Both sides shall use their best efforts to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>b. If the disputed pairing can be reconstructed, rebuilt, or combined into another pairing so that the overall cost of the pairing is the same or essentially the same as prior to the reconstruction and the change does not compromise system form or reliability, then the pairing shall be changed accordingly.</p>
<p>c. Additionally, if on a recurring basis, a pairing, disputed or not, appears in open time and is routinely avoided by pilots trip trading or eligible for make-up, OTP, etc., and therefore must be assigned to a reserve pilot, the above procedure shall apply, unless the Association elects to pursue the VP/MEC Chairman track instead.</p>
<p>2.   If a schedule construction issue(s) or pairing dispute(s) is not solved in the SIG, the quarterly meeting, or at the Scheduling Dispute Board levels, the ALPA SIG may choose to submit the dispute to an independent neutral mutually selected by both parties. The neutral shall gather facts, report findings and within 14 calendar days offer a recommendation to the Senior V.P. of Flight Operations. The neutral may recommend the course of action that he finds which balances the competing needs and interests of both parties. The cost of the neutral shall be borne equally by both the Company and the Association.</p>
<p>3.   The Senior V.P. of Flight Operations shall review the findings of the neutral within 7 business days and issue a final decision concerning the matter. That decision shall be final and shall be sent to the neutral, the V.P. Flight Ops, and the members of the SIG.</p>
<p>G. Final Resolution of Scheduling Disputes: VP/MEC Chairman Track</p>
<p>The MEC Chairman may elect to notify the Vice President, Flight Operations that he is invoking the VP/MEC Chairman track regarding a particular SIG dispute. The notification shall be in writing and shall state the unresolved concerns/problems and the Association’s position. Upon receipt, the Vice President, Flight Operations shall promptly have the stated unresolved concerns/problems investigated, including a review of the process undertaken thus far regarding the dispute. After at least one bid period of flying data is gathered on the disputed pairing, the Vice President, Flight Operations shall meet with the MEC Chairman at a mutually acceptable date and time to review the results of the investigation and discuss options for dealing with the unresolved concerns/problems. Following the meeting, the Vice President, Flight Operations shall advise the MEC Chairman in writing of what actions, if any, the Company shall take to address the presented concerns.</p>
<p>H. Removal and Compensation of Association Members of SIG and PSIT</p>
<p>1.   Removal</p>
<p>a. The Association members of the SIG shall be removed from flying at the Association’s notification as provided in <a href="#link_18A2a" target="_blank">Section 18.A.2.a.</a></p>
<p>b. PSIT members shall be removed from flying as provided in <a href="#link_18A2b" target="_blank">Section 18.A.2.b.</a>, provided such members are not requesting removal of an activity over a designated corporate holiday. Requests for removal over a holiday shall be processed as provided in <a href="#link_18A3" target="_blank">Section 18.A.3.</a>, unless the build week conflicts with a corporate holiday in which case the removals shall be processed as provided in <a href="#link_18A2b" target="_blank">Section 18.A.2.b.</a></p>
<p>2.   Compensation</p>
<p>a. SIG members</p>
<p>The Association SIG members shall receive compensation and benefits as provided in Section 18.</p>
<p>b. PSIT members</p>
<p>The primary members participating in a build month shall be compensated by the Company by being removed from scheduled activities with a standard value of 30 CH (12 CH for any FDA with fewer than 35 lines, 18 CH for any FDA with 35 to 55 lines, and 30 CH for any FDA with 55 or more lines) at the discretion of the SIG for each month that he is designated to complete the pairings/line construction cycle for his designated aircraft. Any additional credit hour value shall be reimbursed by the Association in accordance with Section 18, or the pilot shall be eligible to make up the difference. The Association shall notify the Company whether the excess credit hours are to be removed for Association business or dropped eligible for make-up. If a PSIT member is assigned to work additional days, he shall be removed from scheduled activities with a value of 6 CH for each additional work day (or portion thereof), and he shall be eligible to make up the difference between credit hours removed and credit hours earned for PSIT activities. PSIT members shall be entitled to OTP status for any make-up entitlement arising from this paragraph.</p>
<p>I. Resignation</p>

<p>2.   SIG/PSIT Travel and Expenses</p>
<p>a. The MEC Scheduling Committee Chairman will provide the Company a list of the PSIT and Association SIG participants that will be building bid period packages for the following bid period. Except for PSIT members assigned to an FDA, the Company shall provide a commercial airline ticket to the SIG/PSIT members to or from Memphis for the build week and other mutually agreed SIG/PSIT work. The Association SIG/PSIT members shall have the ability to utilize their deviation banks and/or business jumpseats (or equivalent jumpseat status) to travel to or from Memphis for such activities.</p>
<p>b. The Company shall reimburse an Association member of the SIG or PSIT, consistent with Company policy and subject to approval by the SIG Chairman, for reasonable expenses related to such member’s SIG/PSIT duties, including, but not limited to, hotels, telephone calls, high speed internet access, transportation (car rental), and meals.</p>
<p>3.   Reviewers</p>
<p>The MEC Scheduling Chairman shall have the ability to utilize designated pilots to review the preliminary and final pairings. Unless otherwise agreed by the MEC Scheduling Chairman and the SIG Chairman, the number of reviewers shall be limited to 5 per base.</p>
<p>4.   Training of SIG/PSIT Members</p>
<p>The Company shall reimburse pilots for training required to be a SIG/PSIT member. Reimbursable training is two full build weeks per trainee. Unless otherwise agreed by the Company, reimbursable training shall be limited to a maximum of two PSIT members per month with an annual maximum of eight PSIT members.</p>

<div class="four" id="section26">
<h1 class="persist-header">Section 26: General</h1>
<p>A.   Aircraft Data Collection Systems</p>
<p>1. Definitions</p>
<p>a.   Flight Data Recorder means any device, equipment or system maintained on board an aircraft that transmits and/or records and/or collects inflight data on the subjects of pilot, aircraft component or aircraft performance.</p>
<p>b.   Cockpit Voice Recorder means any device, equipment or system maintained on board an aircraft that monitors or records a pilot’s voice while he is on the aircraft.</p>
<p>c.   Inflight data includes, but is not limited to, all aircraft facts and quantitative details recorded and associated with the aircraft’s operation in an alleged incident/event. For purposes of this definition Flight Safety Reports are considered inflight data.</p>
<p>2. Information obtained from a flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder or any other device as described in <a href="#link_26A5" target="_blank">Section 26.A.5.</a> shall not serve as a basis for discipline or discharge of a pilot. Proficiency or line checks conducted pursuant to any Safety investigation are not considered disciplinary action.</p>
<p>3. Information obtained from a flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder or any other device as described in <a href="#link_26A5" target="_blank">Section 26.A.5.</a> shall not be disclosed or released by the Company to a third party except that the Company must release the flight data recorder, voice recorder data or other inflight collection devices to the National Safety Board or, where applicable, to other foreign or domestic governmental accident or criminal investigation agencies for accident/incident investigation purposes.</p>
<p>4. Information obtained from a flight data recorder or a cockpit voice recorder shall not be audited to evaluate or monitor the judgment or performance of an individual pilot or crew. That information, however, may be used for the purpose of evaluating or improving the Company’s training program. In the event that information from a flight data recorder is used in a Company training program, the names of the flight deck crew shall not be disclosed. Cockpit voice recordings may also be used in training but the voices of the flight deck crews shall not be used or reproduced in any manner. Transcripts may be made and recorded by personnel to reproduce the recording on tape or other multimedia device. Actual voices of the pilots involved shall never be used.</p>
<p class="highlight" id="link_26A5">5. Federal Express Corporation shall only release data from an aircraft data recording and/or data transmitting device, to an individual or entity outside of the Company if required by law, or where the Company desires to disclose de-identified data or analysis of such data to a third party solely for the purpose of evaluating aircraft engine or component performance, weather data, or other operational analysis. Information released to a third party shall be de-identified to the maximum extent possible. The Association will be briefed prior to the exchange being made.</p>
<p>6. Should the Company decide to install a new type of instrument or device not previously utilized on Company aircraft which is capable of collecting and/or reporting flight performance data of an aircraft, the Company shall consult with and receive input from the Association prior to installation. The consultation process between the Company and the Association is intended to be a meaningful, constructive, two-way process in which the parties address the suitability of the proposed installation and any issues of pilot concern. This process will occur before a decision is made to install the new device. It is the intent of this paragraph to require only one notification when an installation of such equipment is to be installed on more than one aircraft of a type. It is neither the intent nor the purpose of this paragraph to require notification for purposes of normal or emergency maintenance or flight test work on aircraft.</p>
<p>7. Flight Safety Reports will be sent only to the Flight Safety Department and the contents will only be used by the Flight Safety Department to conduct their investigation. The contents will not be shared with Flight Management or the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and will not be used for disciplinary purposes.</p>
<p>8. [Reserved]</p>
<p>9. In the event a FedEx aircraft is involved in an accident/incident/event, the pilots who comprise the Association’s accident investigators (who have been designated and listed with Jumpseat Administration) will be authorized Business Emergency or an equivalent booking status for jumpseating on a FedEx aircraft in response to the accident/incident/event.</p>
<p>10.    Pilots involved in an accident/incident/event will be removed from trips with pay during the investigation, if any. Pilots will be paid training pay as appropriate for the time spent during days off cooperating with any investigation or completing any assigned retraining.</p>
<p>B.   Appearance, Uniforms and Accessories</p>
<p>1. The Company may establish and maintain reasonable standards concerning personal grooming and appearance and the wearing of uniforms and accessories. Pilots shall wear the uniform authorized by the Company.</p>
<p>2. A pilot shall wear his Company identification card so as to be visible on his outer most clothing at all times while on Company property.</p>
<p>3.   The Company shall provide all pilots hired on or after the effective date of this Agreement with the following uniform items:</p>
<p>a.   Pants (2 pair);</p>
<p>b.   Shirts (5), including 2 pairs of epaulets;</p>
<p>c.   Ties (2);</p>
<p>d.   Blouse (1);</p>
<p>e.   Cold-weather/foul-weather parka (1);</p>
<p>f.   Belt (2); and</p>
<p>g.   Other required uniform items agreed upon by the Company and the Association.</p>
<p>4.   Each calendar year, a pilot may purchase, from a Company approved uniform vendor(s), replacements for the required uniform items listed in <a href="#link_26B3" target="_blank">Section 26.B.3.</a> and/or the optional uniform items (and quantities) listed on the Company’s approved uniform items list. This list may be adjusted from time-to-time by the Company after consultation with the Association’s Uniform Committee Chairman.</p>
<p>The Company’s approved uniform vendor(s) shall direct bill the Company for the pilot’s purchases, up to $200 per year, unless a direct bill arrangement is not feasible for the vendor(s), in which case the pilot may purchase items from the approved uniform vendor(s) and be reimbursed by the Company. Any purchases from the Company’s approved uniform vendor(s) over $200 per year shall be the pilot’s responsibility.</p>
<p>5. The recommendations of the Association shall be considered by the Company before making any change in the style, color or material of uniforms. The cost of any Company prescribed change in uniform shall be borne by the Company.</p>
<p>6. The Company shall provide free of charge any insignia prescribed as part of the pilot uniform. The insignia shall remain the property of the Company. A pilot shall bear the cost of replacing the insignia if lost.</p>

This paragraph does not apply to programs within the scope of this Agreement.</p>
<p>J.   Jumpseats</p>
<p>1. To the extent permitted by law or regulation, pilots shall be given access to Company jumpseats on terms no less favorable than those provided in the Company jumpseat policy effective January 25, 1998, and included in the PBB.

<p>a.   The period beginning at scheduled showtime of a pilot’s inbound jumpseat and ending 30 minutes after the scheduled termination of his first duty period must be less than 13:30.</p>
<p>b.   There must be at least 1:30 hours between the scheduled block-in of the inbound jumpseat and the showtime of the pilot’s trip.</p>
<p>c.   A pilot positioning to his base on a Company jumpseat shall take proactive steps to be aware of any circumstance which could prevent his timely report to work (e.g., potential maintenance, weather or FAA delays, reroutes). A pilot shall notify CRS at the first indication that a bump, cancellation, reroute or delay of his inbound jumpseat may prevent him from checking in by his scheduled showtime.</p>
<p>d.   If a pilot positioning to his base on a Company jumpseat consistent with the provisions of this paragraph cannot report by showtime due to bump, cancellation, reroute or delay of his inbound jumpseat, CRS may remove the pilot without pay. If a pilot is removed under this paragraph, he shall be eligible for make-up (and shall not be eligible for substitution). There is no discipline associated with the removal if the pilot followed the parameters described above.</p>
<p>e.   The provisions of <a href="#link_26J2" target="_blank">Section 26.J.2.</a> are predicated upon the premise that time spent on a pilot scheduled Company jumpseat is not accrued duty time under this contract or the FARs. Should the Company be required to consider time spent on a pilot scheduled Company jumpseat as accrued duty time, <a href="#link_26J2" target="_blank">Section 26.J.2.</a> shall become null and void immediately.</p>

<p>a.   The Company or the Association may, by written request, initiate conferences to negotiate agreements governing whether that equipment shall be considered a wide-body, narrow-body, or some new category of aircraft for the purposes of pay. Conferences shall commence no later than 30 days following receipt of the written request for those conferences.</p>
<p>b.   If no agreement has been reached within 30 days following commencement of conferences, a non-disciplinary panel of the System Board shall be convened as provided in Section 21 for the purpose of establishing whether that equipment shall be considered a wide-body, narrow-body, or some new category of aircraft for the purposes of pay, notwithstanding the provisions of <a href="#link_21A4" target="_blank">Section 21.A.4.</a> (Jurisdiction of System Board).</p>
<p>c.   The decision of the System Board shall be incorporated into this Agreement by reference. If the Company has placed the aircraft in service at a designated rate of pay before the System Board issues its decision, then the rates of pay determined by the System Board shall be applied retroactively.</p>
<p>d.   The provisions of Section 31 of this Agreement shall not prevent the operation of <a href="#link_26K" target="_blank">Section 26.K.</a></p>
<p>2. If the Company introduces B737 aircraft, those aircraft will be considered narrow body aircraft. All B777 aircraft shall be considered wide body aircraft.</p>

<p>3. Amendment of Insurance Plans</p>
<p>a.   All Insurance Plans are incorporated by reference into this Agreement. Notwithstanding any language in an Insurance Plan to the contrary, the amendment of an Insurance Plan as it applies to pilots (including but not limited to any change in premiums/contributions, coverage or benefit levels) is subject to the consent of the Association in accordance with the procedures applicable to the amendment of the Agreement, except as provided below in this <a href="#link_27A3" target="_blank">Section 27.A.3.</a> and in <a href="#link_27C1" target="_blank">Section 27.C.1.</a></p>
<p>b.   The Company, through its Pilot Benefits Administration Department, shall make all amendments to any or all plans as are required by applicable law. The Company shall provide as much advance notice of such amendments, and corresponding revisions to the PBB, as is practicable. If an amendment to the Insurance Plans or the PBB is required by law, and if there is more than one alternative available under the law with respect to such required amendment(s), then the Company shall present to, and discuss the alternatives with the Association as far in advance of the effective date of the required amendment(s) as is practicable, and if the effectuation of either alternative would result in similar cost to the Company, the consent of the Association to one of the alternatives shall be required for such plan amendment. Such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Association’s consent shall not be required for any amendment described in this paragraph if more than one alternative is available under the law but the effectuation of one or more of the alternatives would result in increased cost to the Company over the other available alternative(s).</p>
<p>c.   If any vendor of the Insurance Plans (i) incurs financial distress, such that it no longer meets the Company’s contracting requirements, (ii) is sold to, acquired by, or merged with another entity and because of such sale, acquisition or merger is unable to fulfill its contractual obligations to the Company, or (iii) is unable to meet the Company’s contracting requirements for the plans contracted for, the Company shall, after notification to the Association, select a vendor to assure that the Insurance Plans are properly supported.</p>
<p>d.   The Company may replace “subordinate vendors” provided the Company shall first notify and consult with the Association regarding such intended action as soon as practical and explain to the Association the reasons that the “subordinate vendor” is being replaced to better support the Insurance Plans. The current cumulative list of “subordinate vendors” consists of: HealthEquity (as new vendor for new HSA/HRA, and as replacement vendor for Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account and Health Care FSAs for Pilots), Davis Vision (vision benefits), MetLife (Dental) or the replacement vendors for vision and dental benefits as described in <a href="#link_27G13" target="_blank">Section 27.G.13.</a>, MetLife (Voluntary Programs), Aetna (Disability program), Lincoln National (Basic Life Insurance and SIB), Prudential (Optional Life Insurance), National Union Fire Insurance (Accidental Death and Dismemberment, Business Travel Accident and CRAF/AMC), ADP (COBRA), LifeCare (WorkLife), Mercer HR Services for the Health Reimbursement Arrangement for Retired Pilots.</p>

At any meeting of the Insurance Board, the Company members and Association members may be accompanied by individuals they deem appropriate.

<p>b.   The benefits specialists for the Company and the Association shall agree on an agenda for each meeting at least one week in advance of such meetings, and shall notify the Company of any agenda items which need to be addressed at the meeting so that the Company may designate the appropriate personnel to attend on behalf of the Company. Should the meeting be scheduled to cover multiple agenda items, the parties shall exchange a list of attendees based on the agenda items. The meetings held by the Company and the Association pursuant to this provision shall exclude any discussion related to any single claim made by an individual pilot and/or his covered dependents which would be protected by federal or state health privacy laws or properly appealed pursuant to ERISA. De-identified information may be used when necessary to discuss systemic issues.</p>
<p>c.   The Insurance Board may also agree to meet with the claims paying administrators of the Insurance Plans. The agenda for such meetings must be jointly agreed upon by the Company and the Association at least fourteen (14) days in advance of any such meetings, in order to give all participants, including the claims paying administrators, sufficient opportunity to prepare for such meetings.</p>
<p>d.   The meetings of the Insurance Board (and, if applicable, the claims paying administrators) which are held pursuant to this provision may take place either face-to-face or by conference call, as agreed by the Insurance Board.</p>

<p>a.   As described in the Insurance Plans and the PBB, benefit denials shall be reviewed by the appropriate claims paying administrator. The Company may remove or replace such claims paying administrators as provided in <a href="#link_27A3" target="_blank">Section 27.A.3.</a></p>
<p>b.   A claimant (pilot, former pilot, retired pilot, spouse, child or beneficiary) or authorized representative may appeal a claim which is denied through the claims and appeals process established by the claims paying administrator. If the claimant is not satisfied with the decision on appeal, he/she may seek review of the decision by the Pilot Benefit Review Board in accordance with the provisions of <a href="#link_27T" target="_blank">Section 27.T.</a> within 120 days of the decision. With respect to a claimant challenging his/her individual claim denial under this paragraph, the provisions of <a href="#link_27A3a" target="_blank">Section 27.A.3.a.</a> (incorporating certain plans into the Agreement by reference) shall not afford him/her greater remedies than if such plans had been incorporated solely for the purposes of resolving his individual appeal.</p>
<p>c.   Any denial of a claim for benefits, whether on the initial claims or an appeal, that is based on vendor guidelines shall be accompanied by either a copy of such guidelines or specific instructions on accessing such guidelines.</p>
<p>7. Procedures regarding amendment of Insurance Plans shall be as follows:</p>
<p>a.   No later than May 2, 2016, the Company shall provide the Association with proposed amendments effectuating the changes to the Insurance Plans contemplated by this Agreement.

The Association’s approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, the failure of the Association to timely approve such updates shall not prevent the Company from distributing the updates to the pilots in accordance with the provisions of ERISA §104(b).</p>
<p>b.   With respect to any future updates to the PBB, the Company shall prepare and distribute to the pilots updates to the PBB as required by ERISA §104(b). The Association shall be given no less than 60 days to review and approve such updates; the Association’s approval of such updates shall not be unreasonably withheld. The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, the failure of the Association to timely approve such updates shall not prevent the Company from distributing the updates to the pilots in accordance with the provisions of ERISA §104(b).</p>
<p>9. The parties recognize that the future cost, delivery and structure of health care (including retiree health care) is an area of particular concern to both sides. The parties pledge their mutual cooperation in dealing with new health care initiatives, legislation, regulation and other future health care issues as they might affect both the pilots and the Company.</p>
<p>10.    Medical, dental, vision, optional life, and optional AD&amp;D will be canceled as a result of a pilot’s failure to pay premiums/contributions, as applicable, while on leave of absence.</p>
<p>11.    In the event that any of the Company’s health plans for pilots are projected to generate an excise tax for a calendar year under Section 4980I of the Internal Revenue Code (“Excise Tax”), the Company shall notify the Association by January 15 or the next business day of the prior calendar year, and that plan shall be treated in accordance with this <a href="#link_27A11" target="_blank">Section 27.A.11.</a> as follows:</p>
<p>a.   Buy-Up Plan Option- For any plan year that the plan is projected to generate an Excise Tax, the Company will make the following changes prior to annual benefits enrollment for the calendar year to the minimum extent necessary to avoid the Excise Tax.</p>
<p>i. First, the allowable employee pre-tax contribution to the participant’s Full Purpose FSA shall be reduced or eliminated.</p>
<p>ii.    Second, the Company and the Association shall invoke the process detailed in the letter entitled, “Process for Handling Potential Onset of Excise Tax” dated November 2, 2015, to reach an agreement on what modifications to the plan’s deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums and/or other provisions should be implemented to avoid the Excise Tax and how the value of any benefit reductions resulting from such modifications shall be provided to the Pilots.</p>
<p>b.   Purple CDHP Option and/or Orange CDHP Option- For any plan year that a plan is projected to generate an Excise Tax, the Company will make the following changes prior to annual benefits enrollment for the calendar year to the minimum extent necessary to avoid the Excise Tax.</p>
<p>i. First, the allowable employee pre-tax contribution to the participant’s Full Purpose FSA (CDHP with HRA) or Limited Purpose FSA (CDHP with HSA) shall be reduced or eliminated.</p>
<p>ii.    Second, the employee’s pre-tax contribution to the participant’s HSA shall be reduced or eliminated, and moved to an after-tax contribution.</p>
<p>iii.   Third, the Company’s contribution to each participant’s HSA/HRA for wellness incentives shall be reduced or eliminated, such reduction shall be paid to the participant in cash.</p>
<p>iv.    Fourth, the Company’s other contributions to each participant’s HSA/HRA shall be reduced or eliminated.</p>
<p>If there is a reduction pursuant to <a href="#link_27A11biv" target="_blank">Section 27.A.11.b.iv.</a>, the pilot’s monthly contributions for coverage will be reduced simultaneously by a corresponding amount, provided, however, that the resulting contributions will not fall below 50% of the contribution amounts established for that calendar year in paragraph 27.G.6.</p>
<p>v. Fifth, the Company and the Association shall invoke the process detailed in the letter entitled, “Process for Handling Potential Onset of Excise Tax” dated November 2, 2015, to reach an agreement on what modifications to the plan’s deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums and/or other provisions should be implemented to avoid the Excise Tax and how the value of any benefit reductions resulting from such modifications shall be provided to the Pilots.</p>
<p>c.   If the law governing the Excise Tax is modified or clarified, the parties shall meet to discuss and agree how any such changes shall be reflected in the plans.</p>
<p>B.   Basic Life Insurance Plan</p>
<p>1. The Company shall continue to provide Basic Life Insurance coverage. A pilot must comply with the eligibility requirements of the Basic Life Insurance plan or lose or risk losing coverage. Coverage levels for Basic Life Insurance shall not be decreased.</p>
<p>2. Basic Life Insurance Plan premiums shall be paid by the Company.</p>
<p>3. The life insurance benefit provided under the Basic Life Plan shall equal $800,000. Pursuant to the procedures established by the insurance carrier, the pilot may elect to receive coverage for a lower life insurance benefit amount, in any multiple of $100,000, with a minimum of $300,000, in lieu of $800,000. During each annual enrollment period, a pilot who is actively at work may elect to receive a different coverage amount, as described herein, and such election shall be effective on the date provided by the insurance carrier. Should a pilot elect to increase his coverage amount, he must provide such proof of insurability as is required by the insurance carrier.</p>
<p>4. Coverage under the Basic Life Plan begins for a pilot upon his date of hire, or if later, the first day he is actively at work.</p>
<p>5. Coverage under the Basic Life Plan shall end as provided in the policy.</p>
<p>6. Other restrictions, requirements and limitations of the Basic Life Plan are described in the policy.</p>
<p>C.   Optional Life Insurance Plan</p>
<p>1. The Company shall continue the Optional Life Insurance Plan. A pilot must comply with the requirements of the plan or lose or risk losing coverage. Coverage levels shall not be decreased. Until the effective date of a new insurance policy under <a href="#link_27F1" target="_blank">Section 27.F.1.</a>, except for routine and scheduled premium adjustments caused by a pilot moving between rated age categories, a non-retired pilot’s premium payments for equal amounts of coverage shall not be increased. Upon the effective date of a new insurance policy under <a href="#link_27F1" target="_blank">Section 27.F.1.</a>, routine and scheduled premium adjustments caused by a pilot moving between rated age categories and premium increases/decreases imposed by the vendor will be paid by the pilot.</p>
<p>2. A pilot may elect to purchase Optional Life Insurance coverage in increments of $100,000 to a maximum of $1,000,000 of coverage, at the premium rate provided by the insurer for such coverage. A pilot’s Optional Life Insurance Plan coverage shall not exceed ten (10) times the pilot’s basic annual salary (rounded to the nearest $1,000). This amount shall be reduced by 8% each year beginning on the pilot’s 65th birthday as follows:</p>
<p>92% continued at age 65</p>
<p>84.64% continued at age 66</p>
<p>77.87% continued at age 67</p>
<p>71.64% continued at age 68</p>
<p>65.91% continued at age 69, after which there shall be no further <br/>
        reduction.</p>
<p>In order to make the election referenced in this paragraph, a pilot must be actively at work on the date that he makes such election and his date of death must be on or after the date of the election.</p>
<p>Additionally, a pilot may purchase Optional Life Insurance coverage of $25,000 for his spouse, $5,000 for dependent children six months and older and $1,000 for dependent children younger than six months old (child must be alive at birth).</p>
<p>3. Eligibility for coverage under the Optional Life Plan begins for a pilot upon his date of hire, or if later, the first day the pilot is actively at work. If a pilot fails to complete the enrollment procedure described in the policy within the first 31 days after his date of hire, he may enroll in the Optional Life Plan; however, he may only enroll under the Optional Life Plan upon providing proof of insurability to the insurance company that underwrites the Optional Life Plan, or during open enrollment periods, should they be offered to all pilots.</p>
<p>4. An individual pilot’s coverage under the Optional Life Plan shall end as provided in the policy.</p>
<p>5. A pilot who is enrolled in the Optional Life Plan and who (i) retires on or after his 55th birthday, and (ii) is active at work immediately prior to the date of his retirement, may, within 31 days of the later of his retirement date or the date on which he receives notice, enroll in Optional Life insurance for retirees at the premium rate provided by the insurer for such coverage. Such coverage may be purchased in increments of $100,000, to the lesser of $300,000 of coverage (or such higher amount as the Optional Life insurance policy may specify) or the pilot’s pre-retirement Optional Life coverage level, as elected by the pilot. Additionally, a retiring pilot may purchase a maximum of $25,000 coverage (or such higher amount as the Optional Life insurance policy may specify) on his spouse, provided the spouse had Optional Life insurance coverage prior to the pilot’s retirement; coverage for a spouse may only be continued while coverage is in effect for the pilot. No increases in coverage will be allowed after enrollment; however, a pilot who elected coverage in an amount greater than $100,000 shall be permitted to reduce the amount of coverage, but not below $100,000. This amount shall be reduced by 8% each year beginning on the pilot’s 65th birthday as follows:</p>
<p>92% continued at age 65</p>
<p>84.64% continued at age 66</p>
<p>77.87% continued at age 67</p>
<p>71.64% continued at age 68</p>
<p>65.91% continued at age 69, after which there shall be no further <br/>
        reduction.</p>
<p>6. Coverage shall terminate at the pilot’s attainment of age 80, at which time the pilot may elect to convert his Optional Life insurance coverage to coverage under an individual insurance policy.</p>
<p>7. A pilot who is enrolled in the Optional Life Plan and who (i) terminates before his 55th birthday, and (ii) is actively at work immediately prior to the date of his termination may, within 31 days of the later of his termination date or the date on which he receives notice, enroll in Optional Life Portability insurance at the premium rate provided by the insurer for such coverage. Such coverage may be purchased up to the lesser of the pilot’s pre-termination Optional Life coverage level or $1,000,000 not to exceed five (5) times the amount of pre-termination salary. The minimum amount of coverage is $20,000. Additionally, a terminating pilot may purchase a maximum of $25,000 coverage on his spouse and $5,000 on eligible children, provided the spouse had Optional Life insurance coverage prior to the pilot’s termination and dependents are not home-confined or hospital-confined on the day prior to the pilot’s termination; dependent coverage may only be continued while coverage is in effect for the pilot. No increases in coverage will be allowed after enrollment; however, a pilot who elected coverage in an amount greater than $20,000 shall be permitted to reduce the amount of coverage. The life insurance benefit will reduce to 60% at age 65 and 50% at age 70. Coverage shall terminate at the pilot’s attainment of age 80, at which time the pilot may elect to convert his Optional Life Portability Insurance coverage to coverage under an individual policy.</p>
<p>8. Subject to <a href="#link_27C1" target="_blank">Section 27.C.1.</a>, pilots enrolled for coverage in the Optional Life Plan will pay all premiums required by the insurer.</p>
<p>9. As of the date the vendor is selected in accordance with <a href="#link_27F1" target="_blank">Section 27.F.1.</a>, the insurance company for the Optional Life Insurance Plan shall not be the same insurance company then in place for the FDX MEC life insurance policy.</p>
<p>D.   Basic and Optional Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance Plan</p>
<p>1. The Company shall continue the Basic and Optional Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance Plan (AD&amp;D). A pilot must comply with the requirements of the plan or lose or risk losing coverage. Coverage levels shall not be decreased during the term of this Agreement. A pilot’s premium payments, if any, shall not be increased for equal amounts of coverage.</p>
<p>2. Basic AD&amp;D Plan premiums shall be paid by the Company; Optional AD&amp;D Plan premiums shall be paid by the pilot. Premium amounts for the optional coverage are provided in the AD&amp;D Plan.</p>
<p>3. The life insurance benefit provided under the basic portion of the AD&amp;D Plan shall be fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000). The life insurance benefit available under the optional portion of the AD&amp;D Plan shall be available in increments; the first increment shall be thirty-five thousand ($35,000) and all additional increments shall be fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), up to a maximum optional benefit of two hundred thirty-five thousand dollars ($235,000).</p>
<p>4. Eligibility for coverage under the optional portion of the AD&amp;D Plan begins for a pilot upon his date of hire. Coverage under the optional portion of this plan shall begin on the first day of the month following the pilot’s completion of the application procedure described in the PBB and upon the payment of the required premium. If Optional AD&amp;D coverage is elected during the Annual Enrollment period, coverage is effective January 1 of the following year. Coverage under the basic portion of this plan shall begin upon a pilot’s date of hire, or if later, the first day he is actively at work.</p>
<p>5. Coverage under the AD&amp;D Plan shall end as provided in the policy.</p>
<p>6. Other restrictions, requirements and limitations of the AD&amp;D Plan are described in the AD&amp;D policy.</p>

<p>c.   The life insurance benefit provided under the Business Travel Accident Insurance Plan shall be $150,000 if a pilot is traveling on Company business, including: (i) flying a Company aircraft as part of his occupation, or (ii) while traveling on Company business on any aircraft that is owned, rented, chartered or leased by the Company.</p>
<p>d.   Coverage under the Business Travel Accident Insurance Plan begins for a pilot upon his date of hire.</p>

A pilot shall not be covered while commuting to and from work. For purposes of this paragraph, “work” shall include the airport in which deadhead or deviation travel originates or terminates, as applicable. A pilot who deviates is considered to be on business travel while traveling pursuant to the provisions of Section 8 of this Agreement. Other restrictions, requirements and limitations are described in the Business Travel Accident Insurance Plan, policy, and the certificate.</p>
<p>2. The Company shall continue the CRAF Accident Insurance coverage under the Federal Express Corporation Business Travel Accident (BTA) Plan on the following terms:</p>
<p>a.   CRAF Accident Insurance Plan premiums shall be paid by the Company.</p>
<p>b.   In the event of a pilot’s death while performing a CRAF mission (defined as a trip(s) that qualifies for the CRAF premium), the coverage shall provide an additional $200,000 of benefits to the surviving beneficiaries up to an aggregate limit of $2,000,000 per aircraft in accordance with Paragraph D. of the CRAF LOA executed July 10, 2003.</p>

<p>d.   A pilot shall be covered from start through the conclusion of the flight sequences that qualify him for the CRAF premium. Other restrictions, requirements and limitations are described in the CRAF Accident Insurance Policy.</p>
<p>F.   Life Insurance RFPs</p>
<p>1. Within 12 months following November 2, 2015, the Company will commence a Request for Proposals (RFP) among insurers, to bid on the Basic and Optional Life, Basic and Optional Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&amp;D), Business Travel Accident (BTA) Insurance and CRAF Accident Insurance Plans with the intent that insurer(s) be selected and new group policies be effective no later than January 1, 2018. The Company and the Association will establish an Optional Life Working Group (OLWG), consisting of two members appointed by the Company and two members appointed by the Association (who, in either case, may be accompanied by individuals they deem appropriate), to perform the following duties with respect to the RFP for the Optional Life and Optional AD&amp;D: development of plan design components and RFP criteria, identification and interviewing of candidates, receipt and review of candidates’ presentations, discuss RFP results and make recommendations to the Company (recommendations may be made by the OLWG as a whole or by individual members or groups of members of the OLWG). The coverage amounts of Optional Life insurance available shall be no less than the coverage amounts currently available, although the OLWG may consider terms of coverage that differ from the terms currently available. All material terms of coverage for Basic Life, Basic AD&amp;D, BTA, CRAF Accident Insurance and Optional AD&amp;D shall be no less favorable than terms of coverage currently available. The Company shall pay the full cost of the RFP process, other than the expenses of the OLWG members appointed by the Association. Promptly following the RFP process, and taking into account the OLWG’s recommendations regarding Optional Life and Optional AD&amp;D, the Company shall select the insurers for all coverages included in the RFP. The Company will first notify and consult with the Association regarding such intended action as soon as practical and explain to the Association the reasons that the vendor is being chosen to better support the Insurance Plans.</p>
<p>2. In the event a new Basic and Optional Life, Basic and Optional AD&amp;D, BTA or CRAF Plan is established under <a href="#link_27F1" target="_blank">Section 27.F.1.</a>, the Company and the Association shall modify Section 27 to the extent necessary to conform to the terms of the Plan.</p>
<p>G.   Group Health Plan for Pilots</p>
<p>1. The Company shall provide to domestic based pilots and pilots based in FDAs (and their eligible covered spouses and dependents) medical benefits (including pharmacy, mental health and substance abuse benefits), dental benefits and vision benefits, in accordance with the terms of the Federal Express Corporation Group Health Plan for Pilots. A pilot must comply with the requirements of the Group Health Plan for Pilots or will lose or risk losing coverage. Any changes to the Group Health Plan for Pilots can only be made as provided in <a href="#link_27A3" target="_blank">Section 27.A.3.</a></p>
<p>2. [Reserved]</p>
<p>3. For domestic based pilots, the Company shall provide medical benefits (including pharmacy, mental health and substance abuse benefits) under the Group Health Plan for Pilots, administered by Anthem. The Health Savings Account (HSA), as described in <a href="#link_27N" target="_blank">Section 27.N.</a>, and the Health Reimbursement Account (HRA), as described in <a href="#link_27O" target="_blank">Section 27.O.</a>, shall be administered by HealthEquity. Effective January 1, 2017, the Company shall provide the Plan options as described in Section 27, Appendix A. For domestic based pilots, effective January 1, 2017, the Company shall provide dental and vision benefits as described in Section 27, Appendix A (except as modified pursuant to <a href="#link_27G13" target="_blank">Section 27.G.13.</a>).</p>
<p>4. For pilots based in FDAs, the Company shall provide medical benefits (including pharmacy, mental health and substance abuse benefits) under the Group Health Plan for Pilots through a fully insured International Plan administered by GeoBlue. Effective January 1, 2017, the International Plan option is described in Section 27, Appendix C. Dental benefits and vision benefits are the same as those provided to domestic based pilots, unless different dental and vision benefits are implemented pursuant to Section 27.G.13.</p>
<p>5. A pilot may elect coverage for medical benefits only (including pharmacy, mental health and substance abuse benefits), dental benefits only, vision benefits only, or any combination. Monthly premiums/contributions will be determined separately for each of the following tiers: pilot only, pilot and child(ren); pilot and spouse; and pilot and family.</p>
<p>6. The Company will provide the Association with the initial monthly contributions/premiums for all Group Health Benefits on November 2, 2015, or as soon as practicable thereafter.

<p style="font-size: 12px">* For pilots based in FDAs, the monthly premium/contribution shall not exceed the amount of the monthly premium/contribution for the same coverage tier in the plan option with the highest monthly contribution offered to domestic-based pilots.</p>
<p>The total projected costs for 2017 and each calendar year thereafter will be determined by an actuary selected by the Company and will be developed from the experience of all pilots and eligible dependents participating in medical, dental and vision coverage, excluding fully-insured options. The Company’s actuary will use reasonable actuarial assumptions and methods that are designed to determine such total projected costs in the actuary’s best professional judgment. By June 15th of each year, the Company will provide to the Association the actuary’s detailed preliminary determination of what the total projected costs will be in the following calendar year. At the Association’s request, the Company and the Company’s actuary will meet with the Association and the Association’s actuary to present and review the Company actuary’s detailed analysis. The Association may provide comments on such analysis by July 7, and the Company’s actuary will consider such comments in making its final determination of total projected costs. For example, by June 15, 2016, the Company will provide to the Association the actuary’s detailed preliminary determination of the total projected costs for 2017, and the Association may provide comments on such analysis by July 7, 2016.</p>
<p>As soon as practicable following the end of 2017 and each calendar year thereafter, the total projected per capita costs for all pilots and survivors paying active rates for that calendar year will be compared to the actual costs for that calendar year. This comparison will be performed in the aggregate for the Buy Up and CDHP options, and separately for dental benefits and vision benefits. The Company will meet with the Association to present these results. If the actual costs are more or less than the total projected costs (outside a corridor of +/- 3%), the difference times the year’s contribution percentage shall be applied to each coverage tier for the next year’s contributions for all pilots and survivors paying active rates participating in that coverage tier in the next calendar year; provided, however, that total monthly contributions for any coverage tier will be not more than 10% over the monthly contributions payable for such coverage tier for the immediately preceding calendar year.</p>
<p>Example: As soon as practicable in 2018, the total projected per capita costs for all pilots and survivors paying active rates for 2017 will be compared to the actual costs for 2017, and if the actual costs are more or less than the total projected costs (outside a corridor of +/-3%), the difference times the 2017 contribution percentage shall be applied to 2019’s contributions for all pilots and survivors paying active rates participating in 2019; provided that the total monthly contributions for any coverage tier will not be more than 10% over the monthly contributions payable for such coverage tier for 2018.</p>
<p>7. The Company will offer plan options for those pilots and eligible dependents living in Hawaii on terms no less favorable than the terms offered to any other employee, as required by state law.</p>
<p>8. In the case of death of a pilot while on the Master Seniority List, the pilot’s eligible surviving spouse and eligible surviving dependents will be eligible for coverage under the Group Health Plan for Pilots and/or the Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots.</p>
<p>9. Coverage under the Group Health Plan for Pilots ends for a pilot and his eligible, covered dependents as provided in the Group Health Plan for Pilots.</p>
<p>10.    Payment of benefits from the Group Health Plan for Pilots is subject to the Plan’s right to reimbursement/subrogation, as described in the reimbursement/subrogation provisions of the Plans and as administered by the Company’s agent for all other employees of the Company.</p>
<p>11.    Other restrictions, requirements and limitations in the Group Health Plan for Pilots described above are set forth in the Group Health Plan for Pilots.</p>
<p>12.    On January 1, 2017, the Company will offer Anthem’s Health Rewards program (wellness program) for pilots and eligible spouses enrolled in the CDHP Purple and Orange options. After completing a Health Assessment and participating in two (2) wellness programs, the pilot and the pilot’s eligible spouse will each earn $300 to be deposited in the HSA (or credited to the HRA as applicable) annually (as soon as practicable after January 1). All information and data submitted by a pilot or a pilot’s spouse related to Health Assessments and wellness programs shall be protected health information that shall not be used by the Company or Anthem for any purpose other than administration of the Group Health Plan for Pilots. The entire cost of amounts earned under this <a href="#link_27G12" target="_blank">Section 27.G.12.</a> shall be borne by the Company and shall not be included in total projected costs or actual costs under <a href="#link_27G6" target="_blank">Section 27.G.6.</a></p>
<p>13.    Within six months following November 2, 2015, the Company will commence a Request for Proposal (RFP) among vendors, to bid on the dental and vision benefits for domestic based pilots and pilots based in FDAs, with the intent that any change(s) in vendor(s) be effective as soon as practicable following November 2, 2015. Except for monthly premiums/contributions, the material terms of dental and vision benefits shall be no less favorable than the terms in effect before November 2, 2015, including the modifications described in Section 27, Appendix A. The RFP will seek fully insured and self-insured bids. The RFP for dental benefits will inquire whether the vendor is able to administer the FAIR Health benchmarks, in lieu of R&amp;C, with respect to out-of-network dental benefits. The Company and the Association will establish a Dental and Vision Working Group (DVWG), consisting of two regular members appointed by the Company and two regular members appointed by the Association. The DVWG will perform the following duties with respect to the RFP: development of plan design components and RFP criteria, identification and interviewing of candidates, receipt and review of candidates’ presentations, discuss RFP results, and make recommendations to the Company (which recommendations may be made by the DVWG as a whole or by individual members or groups of members of the DVWG). The Company shall pay the full cost of the RFP process, other than the expenses of the DVWG members appointed by the Association. Following the RFP process, and taking into account the DVWG’s recommendations, the Company will select new vendors for the dental and vision benefits or will retain the current vendors, and first notify and consult with the Association regarding such intended action as soon as practical and explain to the Association the reasons that the vendor is being chosen to better support the dental and vision benefits for pilots. The dental and vision vendors chosen will be implemented no later than January 1 immediately following 12 months from selection.</p>
<p>14.    The Group Health Plan for Pilots shall be amended effective January 1, 2017, to provide for the following:</p>
<p>a. Provide coverage for:</p>
<p>i. A pilot’s spouse who is in U.S. military service.</p>
<p>ii. A pilot’s spouse who is an employee of the Company (or an affiliate of the Company). However, the spouse cannot be covered both as an employee and as a dependent.</p>
<p>b.   Hearing aids, repairs, batteries and appliances, up to $5,000 every three years (per participant).</p>
<p>c.   Acupuncture based on Anthem’s or GeoBlue’s guidelines, as applicable.</p>
<p>d.   Dental implants for non-accidents as Class IV service and eliminate the lifetime dental benefit.</p>
<p>e.   The following new vision benefits: (i) one routine eye exam once every calendar year (rather than every 12 months), (ii) one pair of frames every two calendar years (rather than every 24 months), one pair of lenses every calendar year (rather than every 12 months), and (iv) contact lenses every calendar year (rather than every 12 months).</p>
<p>15.    The Company will facilitate transparency in the pricing and quality of health care providers (including facilities) by continuing to provide access to a rating system/solution provided that such a system is offered by Anthem (unless the Company and the Association agree upon a different or supplemental system).</p>
<p>16.    The Group Health Plan for Pilots shall provide that determination of the premiums/contributions to be paid by a pilot’s survivors for health coverage (assuming the survivors are eligible for survivor health coverage under the foregoing provisions of <a href="#link_27G" target="_blank">Section 27.G.</a>) shall be as follows, where the pilot’s survivors, prior to the pilot’s death, were covered, along with the pilot, as a single group under a single coverage tier. The Company will provide survivor health coverage, under the foregoing provisions of <a href="#link_27G" target="_blank">Section 27.G.</a> to all of the eligible survivors as a single group under a single coverage tier. The Company will send one information packet to the surviving spouse; if there is not a surviving spouse, the packet will be sent to the oldest child. If all survivors agree on a single coverage tier, only one survivor (the surviving spouse if there is one, otherwise the oldest child) will be charged for the coverage. If all the survivors cannot agree on a single coverage tier, then the survivors will divide themselves into as many separate groups as desired, with the goal of having the least number of coverage groups possible. Each coverage group will be charged for coverage at the applicable rate for that group’s coverage tier. For each coverage group, only one survivor (the surviving spouse if there is one, otherwise the oldest child in the coverage group) will be charged for the coverage. An adult survivor may elect to leave a coverage group and elect either to maintain coverage at the rate applicable to the survivor as an individual (assuming the survivor continues to be eligible for survivor health coverage) or to maintain no coverage, but once an adult survivor elects to leave a coverage group, he or she may not elect to return to that coverage.</p>
<p>H.   Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots (Coverage for Retirees and Eligible Survivors)</p>
<p>1. The Company shall provide medical benefits (including pharmacy, mental health and substance abuse benefits), dental benefits and vision benefits to pilots who have retired on or after February 4, 1999, and their eligible covered spouses and dependents, and their eligible survivors, in accordance with the terms of the Federal Express Corporation Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots. A pilot must comply with the requirements of the Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots or lose or risk losing coverage. Any changes to the Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots can only be made as provided in <a href="#link_27A3" target="_blank">Section 27.A.3.</a></p>
<p>2. A retiring pilot is eligible for retiree coverage under the Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots if he:</p>
<p>a.   was hired before January 1, 1988, is at least 55 years old, and has 10 years of permanent continuous service with the Company after age 45;</p>
<p>b.   was hired on or after January 1, 1988, or was a Flying Tiger employee who began to work for the Company on August 7, 1989, and is at least 55 years old, and has 20 years of continuous service after age 35 (Flying Tiger continuous service plus FedEx permanent continuous service); or</p>
<p>c.   is at least age 60 with at least five years permanent continuous service.</p>
<p>For purposes of this paragraph, “continuous service” means service that begins on the first day of employment with the Company in a permanent full-time or permanent part-time position and which is uninterrupted by resignation, retirement, discharge, reduction in force of more than two years, or reversion to a nonpermanent position.</p>
<p>3. Coverage under the Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots for a retired pilot and for the eligible survivors of active and retired pilots shall be as set forth under Section 27 Appendix B and the plan document, which includes the following:</p>
<p>a.   The Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots shall provide coverage solely for the retiring pilot and/or his eligible spouse and dependents for the period prior to their attaining Medicare eligibility age. Retiring pilots who have attained Medicare eligibility age may, if eligible, elect coverage under the Premium Reimbursement Plan described in <a href="#link_27I" target="_blank">Section 27.I.</a></p>
<p>b.   The Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots shall provide that the following individuals are eligible for coverage:</p>
<p>i.   Retired Pilots. A retired pilot, and the retired pilot’s eligible spouse and eligible dependents, are eligible for coverage if the pilot retires on or after February 4, 1999, after having satisfied the age and service eligibility requirements for retiree health coverage under the plan provisions in effect on the date of the pilot’s retirement.</p>
<p>ii.  Retired Pilot’s Eligible Surviving Spouse and Eligible Surviving Dependents. In the case of death of a retired pilot, the retired pilot’s eligible surviving spouse and eligible surviving dependents will be eligible for coverage under the Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots, as specified in the Plan.</p>
<p>c.   Any Company cost for providing Pre-Medicare coverage which is in excess of one and one-half times the Company’s fiscal 1993 per capita projected cost ($4,813 annually for each Pre-Medicare eligible retired pilot, spouse or surviving spouse) shall be paid by the retired pilot (or survivor).</p>
<p>d.   The monthly premium/contribution for a retired pilot and his eligible spouse and eligible dependents and for eligible survivors is as follows:</p>
<p>i. The Company will pay the first $401.08 per month ($4,813 annually) of the total projected cost of health coverage for each Pre-Medicare eligible retired pilot and the same amount for each eligible spouse and the same amount for each eligible surviving spouse (i.e., the Company’s fiscal 1993 per capita cap is maintained). The remainder of the total projected cost for each pilot and for each spouse will be paid by the covered individual, from the assets in the individual’s Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) or if administratively feasible, the individual’s Health Savings Account (HSA), if any, or from the individual’s other assets.</p>
<p>ii.    For all dependent children and all surviving dependent children (not per child), effective January 1, 2017, the participant’s monthly contribution for coverage will be as follows:</p>
<p>(a) $62.00 for the Buy Up Plan, $28.00 for the CDHP Purple option without HSA/HRA, $28.00 for the CDHP Orange option without HSA/HRA, $62.00 for the HMSA $62.00, Health Plan Hawaii and $26.00 for the High Deductible option; and</p>
<p>(b)  effective January 1, 2018, dependent children and surviving children rates will increase annually by the same percentage increase as retiree and spouse rates.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the annual increase, for calendar year 2018 and beyond, the dependent children and surviving children rate will be the same for both the CDHP Purple (without HSA/HRA) and CDHP Orange (without HSA/HRA) options.</p>
<p>For this purpose, “total projected cost” will be determined by the actuarial firm selected by the Company, exercising its best professional judgment, based on the total blended cost of all retired pilots and non-pilot retirees (and spouses, other dependents and survivors) participating in Pre-Medicare health benefits. Such determination (and supporting data) regarding the pilots’ costs will be shared with the Association in advance of each open enrollment period.</p>
<p>If the Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots is projected to generate an Excise Tax, the Excise Tax will be added to the premiums/contributions and will be paid by the participant.</p>
<p>The Company’s actuary will use reasonable actuarial assumptions and methods that are designed to determine such total projected costs in the actuary’s best professional judgment. By September 15th of each year, the Company will provide to the Association the actuary’s detailed determination of what the total projected costs will be in the following calendar year.</p>
<p>e.   Eligible spouses and dependents on the date that a pilot commences coverage under the Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots, and eligible survivors of retired pilots, are eligible for coverage under the Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots, subject to the provisions in effect on the date of the pilot’s retirement.</p>
<p>f.   A covered individual shall have the option of having his monthly Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots premiums/contributions deducted from his monthly pension check, or his Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) or if administratively feasible, his Health Savings Account (HSA), if applicable. He may also have the option of paying these premiums/contributions by check on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>4. Coverage under the Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots</p>
<p>For retired pilots and other eligible individuals, the Company shall provide medical benefits (including pharmacy, mental health and substance abuse benefits) under the Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots, administered by Anthem. The Plan options are described in Section 27, Appendix B.</p>
<p>5. Through December 31, 2016, medical benefit options (including pharmacy, mental health and substance abuse benefits), dental benefit options and the vision benefit option under the Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots are the same as those in effect for retired pilots on November 1, 2015. Effective January 1, 2017, medical benefit options (including pharmacy, mental health and substance abuse benefits) under the Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots consist of the following, as further described in Section 27, Appendix B: Buy Up Option, CDHP Purple Option (Without HSA/HRA), CDHP Orange Option (Without HSA/HRA), High Deductible Option and Retiree HRA Only Option. Additionally, self-insured or fully-insured dental and vision coverage shall be offered separately from medical (including pharmacy, mental health and substance abuse benefits). The Company will offer plan options for those retired pilots and eligible dependents living in Hawaii on terms no less favorable than the terms offered to any other employee, as required by state law. Dental and vision benefits are the same as those for active pilots as described in Section 27, Appendix A.</p>
<p>6. Payment of benefits from the Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots is subject to the Plan’s right to reimbursement/subrogation, as described in the reimbursement/subrogation provisions of the Plan and as administered by the Company’s agent for all other employees of the Company.</p>
<p>7. Other restrictions, requirements and limitations in the Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots described above are set forth in the Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots, and as described herein.</p>
<p>8. Health Reimbursement Accounts. The Company will continue to administer a Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association (VEBA) with individual Health Reimbursement Accounts (HRAs) for the following individuals:</p>
<p>a.   For each eligible pilot who retired after May 31, 2004, but before August 26, 2006, the Company will deposit the signing bonus otherwise to be provided to these pilots into an individual HRA in the same amount as they would have received under the signing bonus program. A retired pilot is eligible to receive such contribution if he met the age and service requirements for coverage under the Retiree Group Health Plan at his retirement. The Company will make the payment to the HRAs under the VEBA upon establishment of the VEBA, to occur not later than January 28, 2007 (90 days after October 30, 2006).</p>
<p>b.   For each eligible active pilot (i) having a Master Seniority List number on August 25, 2006, (ii) who has attained at least age 53 before January 1, 2007, (iii) who is expected to meet the age and service requirements for coverage under the Retiree Group Health Plan as of his attainment of age 60 or older, and (iv) who retires on or after August 26, 2006, the Company will make a one-time cash payment of restricted signing bonus to the VEBA equal to $25,000. Such contributions shall be made no later than January 28, 2007 (90 days after October 30, 2006). The contribution and interest attributable thereto shall be transferred to the HRA established with respect to that pilot upon the date that the pilot attains age 59, or if earlier, as soon as practicable after the pilot dies. If a pilot attains age 59 or dies prior to the date that the Company funds the VEBA pursuant to this paragraph b., the contribution and interest attributable to such pilot shall be transferred to the HRA as soon as possible after the date on which the Company funds the VEBA.</p>
<p>HRA contributions will not be reduced for a pilot who continues as an active employee past age 60.</p>
<p>There is no requirement that a pilot participate in a Company sponsored Pre-Medicare health care plan when he retires in order to use his HRA or to receive an HRA contribution.</p>
<p>c.   A pilot’s HRA may be used for reimbursement of any qualified medical expenses while retired, including participant premiums/contributions, whether before or after Medicare eligibility. Any unused amounts in the HRA at the time of the pilot’s death (whether before or after retirement) may be used for reimbursement of any qualified medical expenses of the eligible surviving spouse and any other eligible surviving dependents. Any unused amounts in the HRA at the last to die of the pilot, eligible surviving spouse and eligible surviving dependents will be forfeited to the VEBA.</p>
<p>d.   Accounts with minimal balances ($10.00 or less) shall be forfeited after six months of account inactivity. Amounts forfeited to the VEBA will be applied to pay the reasonable administrative expenses of the VEBA.</p>
<p>e.   The Company will pay all administrative expenses of the VEBA in excess of administrative expenses paid out of forfeitures pursuant to the above paragraph.</p>
<p>f.   Participants will be allowed to access their HRA by using a debit card.</p>
<p>9. The Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots shall be amended to provide changes consistent with the changes to the Group Health Plan for Pilots provided in <a href="#link_27G14" target="_blank">Section 27.G.14.</a> (regarding benefit modifications), <a href="#link_27G15" target="_blank">Section 27.G.15.</a> (regarding transparency systems), and <a href="#link_27G16" target="_blank">Section 27.G.16.</a> (regarding survivors’ premiums/contributions). In addition, the Buy Up Option, CDHP Purple Option (Without HSA/HRA) and CDHP Orange Option (Without HSA/HRA) under the Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots shall be amended to provide the same changes as are made to the Buy Up Option, CDHP Purple Option and CDHP Orange Option under the Group Health Plan for Pilots pursuant to <a href="#link_27A11" target="_blank">Section 27.A.11.</a>, whether or not such changes affect application of the Excise Tax to the options under the Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots.</p>
<p>10.    An HRA shall be established for each eligible pilot and eligible spouse who elects the HRA Retiree Only Option under the Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots. The Company shall credit $4,813.00 annually in a separate HRA account for each eligible pilot and eligible spouse. The amount will be prorated in the pilot’s year of retirement. The HRA account is a notional account held in a non-interest bearing account. Any unused amounts in the HRA at the last to die of the pilot, eligible spouse and eligible surviving dependents will be forfeited. Accounts with minimal balances ($10 or less) shall be forfeited after six months of account inactivity, once the pilot and the eligible spouse attain Medicare eligibility. Once an eligible pilot or eligible spouse elects the HRA Retiree Only Option, that participant is not allowed to elect any other option under the Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots.</p>
<p>I.   Premium Reimbursement Plan (Post-Medicare)</p>
<p>1. [Reserved]</p>
<p>2. The Association shall continue to sponsor and maintain a post-Medicare retiree health plan and Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (“VEBA”). Effective January 1, 2014, the plan shall be known as the Premium Reimbursement Plan (PRP). The PRP and VEBA are collectively bargained for purposes of Internal Revenue Code (“Code”) §§419 and 419A.</p>
<p>3. Effective with respect to credit hours paid on or after November 2, 2015, the Company will contribute to the VEBA $1.00, plus an additional $0.05 on the first day of each November bid period thereafter, for each paid credit hour for each pilot having a Master Seniority List number (which would otherwise be paid to the pilot in cash) as the pilot’s ongoing monthly contribution to the PRP/VEBA. The Company shall remit such contributions to the VEBA no later than the 15th day of the calendar month following the calendar month during which the credit hours were actually paid. On the effective date of the Company’s contribution of $1.00 (increased, as provided above) per paid credit hour, the hourly pay rates agreed upon for pilots will be established as book rates. Actual pay rates will be decreased by the per hour contribution specified above. All retirement and welfare benefits based on pay will be based on pay determined under the book rates. The purpose of this provision is to allow the ongoing monthly VEBA contributions per paid credit hour to be funded out of compensation that would otherwise be paid directly to pilots in cash.</p>
<p>4. The PRP and VEBA will be administered by the Administrative Board (Board), which will be composed of three or four members, as determined by the Association. If the Board is composed of three members, each member will be a regular voting member. If the Board is composed of four members, three will be regular voting members and one will be an alternate member who will be a voting member in the absence of one of the regular members. The President of the Association will appoint and remove all members, based on the recommendations of the FedEx MEC. Any member may be an active pilot or a retired pilot; however, there must be at least one active pilot. A quorum is established by three members. Decisions of the Board will be made by majority of the three members voting. The Board will select, monitor and replace all vendors and other providers of services to the PRP and VEBA. The Board will determine the investment policy and will have full responsibility for investment of the VEBA funds. Board members are fiduciaries subject to ERISA’s standards of conduct for fiduciaries. The Board will determine the reasonable administrative expenses which may be paid by the PRP/VEBA.</p>
<p>5. The Association will prepare and adopt the PRP and VEBA documents. The Association shall have the sole power to amend the PRP and VEBA at any time, without the Company’s consent, provided that no modification (i) shall conflict with the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) shall increase the obligations of the Company under this Agreement without the Company’s consent.</p>
<p>6. The PRP will provide a retired pilot, and the retired pilot’s spouse or surviving spouse and the retired pilot’s eligible child with reimbursement of the amount incurred by the individual to obtain coverage under a Medicare Supplemental policy, a Medicare Advantage Plan, Medicare Part D, and/or Tricare, or other available post-Medicare coverage as determined by the Board, up to a maximum monthly reimbursement as determined by the Board. The CBA’s grievance procedures will not apply to any individual benefit claims or appeals of individual benefit claims under the PRP.</p>
<p>7. Any assets remaining in the VEBA in the event of termination of the PRP will be distributed to the following individuals, in such shares as determined by the Board:</p>
<p>a.   Retired pilots participating in the PRP upon termination of the PRP;</p>
<p>b.   Retired pilots who would have participated in the PRP but who, as of termination of the PRP, have not yet attained Medicare eligibility age;</p>
<p>c.   Pilots on whose behalf the Company has remitted any monthly contributions;</p>
<p>d.   Survivors participating in the PRP upon termination of the PRP.</p>
<p>8. The following retired pilots, eligible spouses and eligible dependents, and eligible survivors, shall be eligible to participate in the PRP (“Eligible Individuals”):</p>
<p>a.   A retired pilot who has attained Medicare eligibility age, and the retired pilot’s eligible spouse who has attained Medicare eligibility age, are eligible for coverage under the PRP if the pilot retires on or after February 4, 1999, after having satisfied the age and service eligibility requirements for retiree health coverage under the Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots. The retired pilot’s eligible spouse and eligible dependents who are not eligible for Medicare will remain in the Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots until they are either eligible for Medicare, then enter the PRP, or in the case of a dependent child, cease to be eligible for coverage under the Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots.</p>
<p>b.   Pilot’s Eligible Surviving Spouse and Eligible Surviving Dependents. A pilot’s eligible surviving spouse or eligible surviving dependent who has attained Medicare eligibility age is eligible for coverage under the PRP if the pilot:</p>
<p>i. Retired on or after February 4, 1999, after having satisfied the age and service eligibility requirements for coverage under the Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots; or</p>
<p>ii.    Died on or after October 30, 2006, while on the Master Seniority List, after having satisfied the age and service eligibility requirements for coverage under the Retiree Group Health Plan for Pilots.</p>
<p>c.   The eligibility of a retired pilot or such pilot’s eligible spouse or eligible dependent for coverage under the PRP will begin when that individual attains Medicare age. An Eligible Individual may defer or suspend coverage, and in such event, may commence or resume coverage at a later date, in accordance with procedures determined by the Board.</p>
<p>d.   Effective for pilots who retire after November 2, 2015, or for a surviving spouse or surviving dependent of a retiree health eligible pilot who dies after November 2, 2015, it is not necessary for an individual to be covered under a Company-sponsored health plan immediately prior to coverage under the PRP.</p>
<p>e.   The Board will establish guidelines for opt-out, deferral, suspension and termination of enrollment.</p>
<p>9. With the exception of the remittance of contributions on behalf of pilots as described in <a href="#link_27I3" target="_blank">Section 27.I.3.</a> above, the Company will have no administrative responsibility for the PRP and/or VEBA. However, the Company will provide to the Board such relevant data as is readily available from the Company’s records (or its vendors’ records) and which is necessary or appropriate for the Administrative Board’s proper administration of the PRP.</p>
<p>The Company will make its best efforts to inform the Board of the death of any retired pilots, spouses and dependents, and authorizes the Board to make requests of the Plan administrator of the FedEx Corporation Employees’ Pension Plan. The Company shall have no further responsibility regarding the determination of an Eligible Individual’s eligibility for coverage under the PRP.</p>
<p>10.    The parties agree that at the time this Agreement becomes amendable, the Association and the Company will negotiate further with respect to appropriate future contributions to the VEBA. Ninety days prior to the amendable date, the Association agrees to provide (or have the vendor provide) relevant data, information, claim experience, etc. to the Company in anticipation of and solely with respect to these negotiations.</p>
<p>J.   Disability Plan</p>
<p>1. Except as provided herein, the terms and conditions of the Federal Express Corporation Long Term Disability Plan for Pilots (the “LTD Plan”) shall remain the same and shall not be amended without the consent of the Association, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.</p>
<p>2. A pilot shall be eligible for LTD Plan benefits upon exhaustion of his regular and disability sick accounts, as described in Section 14, or upon his experiencing a seat change or upon moving to a non-pilot position because of disability, as described in the LTD Plan. Except as provided in <a href="#link_27J7" target="_blank">Section 27.J.7.</a>, disability benefits paid to pilots who are disabled prior to October 30, 2006, shall be governed by the terms of the disability plans in effect on the date of commencement of the disability. Pilots who become disabled on or after October 30, 2006, shall be governed by the provisions below.</p>
<p>3. LTD Plan benefits payable to a pilot whose disability commences on or after October 30, 2006, shall equal 60% of monthly earnings, as described in <a href="#link_27J6" target="_blank">Section 27.J.6.</a>, for the first 24 months that a pilot is eligible to receive benefits under the LTD Plan, subject to the limits in <a href="#link_27J7" target="_blank">Section 27.J.7.</a> Thereafter, benefits payable to a pilot who becomes disabled and continues to have an occupational disability shall equal 50% of monthly earnings, as described in <a href="#link_27J6" target="_blank">Section 27.J.6.</a>, and subject to the limits in <a href="#link_27J7" target="_blank">Section 27.J.7.</a> Such benefits shall be paid through the earlier of the date on which such pilot (1) ceases to be disabled, or (2) the date on which the pilot attains age 65.</p>
<p>4. In order for a pilot to continue to be eligible for a disability benefit under the LTD Plan, the pilot must fully cooperate with the Claims Paying Administrator, in coordination with the Aeromedical Advisor, and must diligently seek restoration of any required license or medical certificate to allow the pilot to return to work.</p>
<p>5. The Company shall pay the full cost of such coverage.</p>
<p>6. Monthly earnings shall continue to be defined as a pilot’s basic monthly compensation, i.e., the 12 highest consecutive months out of the 36 consecutive months preceding the disability period.</p>
<p>7. A pilot’s monthly LTD Plan benefit during the first 24 months of disability may not exceed 60% of the monthly compensation limit set forth in Code § 401(a)(17). A pilot’s monthly LTD Plan benefit following the first 24 months of disability may not exceed 50% of the monthly compensation limit set forth in Code § 401(a)(17). Increases to this limit shall be indexed based on periodic adjustments to the limitations of Code § 401(a)(17). The benefit amount adjustments made under this <a href="#link_27J7" target="_blank">Section 27.J.7.</a> are not intended to be one-time adjustments; rather, adjustments will continue to be made in the future, for benefits paid thereafter, at the time of future adjustments to the limitations of Code § 401(a)(17). This <a href="#link_27J7" target="_blank">Section 27.J.7.</a> shall apply to all pilots, whether their benefits began before or after the signing of this Agreement. In the event the limit set forth in Code § 401(a)(17) is decreased legislatively, the Company shall establish a VEBA to cover pilots in the LTD Plan only. Compensation used to calculate benefits to be paid from the newly established VEBA shall be limited annually to the greater of (1) the highest limit under Code § 401(a)(17) in effect at any time prior to it being decreased or (2) the current limit in effect under Code § 401(a)(17).</p>
<p>8. Current LTD Plan provisions concerning the offset for wages earned by a pilot who experiences a disability related seat change or disability related move to a non-pilot position shall remain in effect as provided in the LTD Plan.</p>
<p>9. [Reserved]</p>
<p>10.    The duration of the LTD Plan benefits for mental disorders, as currently defined in the LTD Plan, shall remain at a maximum of 60 months.</p>
<p>11.    Effective on November 2, 2015, the duration of LTD Plan benefits for alcohol and substance abuse shall be at a maximum of 18 months (up to 12 months, plus, for pilots seeking medical recertification, up to an additional 6 months). For pilots whose disability commencement date is before November 2, 2015, the duration of LTD benefits for alcohol and substance abuse will remain at 26 weeks.</p>
<p>12.    Payment of benefits from the LTD Plan is subject to the LTD Plan’s right to reimbursement/subrogation, as described in the reimbursement/subrogation provisions of the LTD Plan and as administered by the Company’s agent for all other employees of the Company.</p>
<p>13.    An LTD Plan reduction arising out of other employment or self-employment during the term of a pilot’s disability shall be applicable to a pilot only after the disability payments plus the outside income earned by the pilot exceed the pilot’s pre-disability income. For purposes of this provision, a pilot’s pre-disability income shall be measured as the average earnings (Company and outside earned income) over the 12 months immediately preceding the pilot’s disability.</p>
<p>For example, a pilot programs software as a side business in addition to flying. He breaks his arm on July 1, 2016, and goes on LTD disability after his sick leave runs out on September 1, 2016. Between July 1, 2015, and July 1, 2016, the pilot made $100,000 as a FedEx pilot and $25,000 in his software business, for a monthly average total of $10,416.66. While on disability, the pilot continues to program software and makes $4,000 per month in addition to drawing a monthly disability of $5,000.00 (for the first 24 months; $4,166 thereafter) from the Company. The $9,000.00 monthly average income is below the $10,416.66 he earned before his disability, so no offset is required. If however, the pilot earned $7,000 per month in the software business, then his total monthly earnings ($12,000.00) would exceed his combined pre-disability monthly income ($10,416.66) by $1,583.34. In this situation, a monthly disability reduction of 50% of the $1,583.34, or $791.67 per month would be required.</p>
<p>14.    Disability benefit payments under the LTD Plan shall end as described in the LTD Plan.</p>
<p>15.    LTD benefits shall be reduced by other benefits and income received during the disability period, as described in the LTD Plan except: (i) as provided in <a href="#link_27J13" target="_blank">Section 27.J.13.</a>, and (ii) the amount of a pilot’s Social Security Disability Income which shall be offset from his LTD benefits in an amount equal to 70% (100% with respect to disabilities commencing prior to October 30, 2006) of the Social Security Disability Income payable to the pilot (excluding any amount payable to the pilot on account of any member of the pilot’s family).</p>
<p>16.    A pilot claiming LTD benefits shall not receive such benefits unless his claim is substantiated by significant objective findings of disability as defined in the LTD Plan.</p>
<p>17.    A pilot shall be subject to restrictions on recurring disability periods as described in the LTD Plan.</p>
<p>18.    LTD benefits shall not be paid for a disability caused by an excludable condition listed in the LTD Plan.</p>
<p>19.    During the period that a pilot is on disability, the pilot shall have access to Company communications systems including pilot.fedex.com, PRISM and Company email.</p>
<p>20.    The Company’s agreement with the current administrator (Aetna Life Insurance Company) of LTD Plan benefits under <a href="#link_27J" target="_blank">Section 27.J.</a> will provide that at any time such entity is also the administrator of benefits under any FDX MEC-sponsored disability plan, a pilot may elect to direct the administrator in writing to share amongst the Federal Express Corporation LTD Plan for Pilots and the FDX MEC sponsored disability plan any and all medical records or medical reports received from any current treating providers, with respect to any one of such plans. Regardless of the sharing of information, each plan shall be administered independently according to its specific plan provisions and procedures and there shall be no collaboration between the Federal Express Corporation LTD Plan for Pilots Plan Administrator and the FDX MEC sponsored Disability Plan Administrator in claims payment decisions under each plan. The pilot must sign and date an Authorization to Share Information Form, approved by both FedEx and the FDX MEC. The pilot is required to provide an updated Authorization to Share Information Form as required by Aetna Life Insurance Company. At any time such entity is not Aetna Life Insurance Company for both the Federal Express Corporation LTD Plan for Pilots and the FDX MEC sponsored disability plan, information will not be shared unless the Company is able to negotiate the same arrangement with the new vendor.</p>
<p>21.    Recovery of overpayments under the LTD Plan will be subject to the Settlement Agreement between the Company and the Association, concerning the Overpayment Recovery Process, dated February 7, 2013.</p>
<p>K.   Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account Plan</p>
<p>Pilots shall continue to be permitted to participate in the Federal Express Corporation Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account Plan, under the same terms and conditions as other employees of the Company, until December 31, 2016. Thereafter, pilots shall be permitted to participate in a Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account Plan up to the maximum amount allowed by law. As soon as practicable after November 2, 2015, such plan will be administered by HealthEquity.</p>
<p>L.   Health Care Contribution Plan</p>
<p>Pilots shall continue to be permitted to participate in the Federal Express Corporation Health Care Contribution Plan.</p>
<p>M.   Health Care Flexible Spending Account Plan for Pilots</p>
<p>Effective February 1, 2016, the Health Care Savings Account Plan for Pilots shall be renamed as the Federal Express Corporation Health Care Flexible Spending Account for Pilots (FSA). Pilots shall be permitted to participate in the FSA up to the maximum amount allowed by law, which shall be amended to comply with HSA compatibility rules. Pilots will be able to use a debit card to access their accounts under the Plan. As soon as practicable after November 2, 2015, such plan will be administered by HealthEquity.</p>
<p>Before 2017, the FSA Plan shall permit a pilot to participate in a Full Purpose Health Care FSA. For 2017 and beyond, the FSA Plan shall permit a pilot to participate only in a Limited Purpose FSA if he participates in a CDHP option for medical benefits, and shall permit a pilot to participate in a Full Purpose FSA if he participates in any other health plan option (including a CDHP option with HRA).</p>
<p>In the case of a pilot who participates in a Full Purpose FSA in one calendar year and switches to a CDHP option with HSA in the next calendar year, the Full Purpose FSA will be converted to a Limited Purpose FSA for the grace period.</p>
<p>N. Health Savings Account (HSA) for Pilots</p>
<p>The Company shall contribute in cash to an HSA for each participant who establishes an HSA with HealthEquity (or successor vendor) and who is covered under a CDHP Option with HSA. HSA contributions shall be in the amount specified in Section 27, Appendix A. The CDHP Options shall meet the requirements of Code §223. With the exception of investment related expenses, the Company shall pay all administrative costs of the HSAs.</p>
<p>If federal law is amended to reduce the maximum amount that may be contributed to an HSA below the amounts specified in Section 27, Appendix A, then the Company shall pay such remaining amount in cash to the participant pursuant to the schedule in Appendix A, if administratively feasible, or as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Pilots will be able to make HSA contributions up to the limits established by law. HSAs established under Section 27 shall allow for participant-directed investment to the maximum extent allowed under HealthEquity’s (or any successor vendor’s) guidelines.</p>
<p>O.   Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA) for Pilots</p>
<p>The Company shall credit to an HRA account for each pilot who elects a CDHP Option with HRA. HRA credits shall be in the amount specified in Section 27, Appendix A. The Company will credit each pilot’s account monthly with interest at an annual rate of 4%. HRA plan options will be administered by HealthEquity (or successor vendor). The Company shall pay all administrative costs of the HRAs. When an active pilot’s participation in the Plan ends due to death or termination from the Company, accounts with minimal balances ($10.00 or less) shall be forfeited after six months of account inactivity.</p>
<p>If federal law is amended to limit the maximum amount that may be credited to an HRA below the amounts specified in Section 27, Appendix A, then the Company shall pay such remaining amount in cash to the participant pursuant to the schedule in Appendix A, if administratively feasible, as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This <a href="#link_27O" target="_blank">Section 27.O.</a> shall not apply to any HRA established prior to November 2, 2015, under <a href="#link_27H8" target="_blank">Section 27.H.8.</a></p>
<p>P.   Long Term Care Plan</p>
<p>Pilots shall continue to be permitted to participate in the Federal Express Corporation Long Term Care Plan, under the same terms and conditions as other employees of the Company. Effective January 1, 2013, this Plan was closed to new enrollees. If the Plan is reopened to new enrollees, pilots shall be permitted to participate under the same terms and conditions as other employees of the Company.</p>
<p>Q.   Group Legal Services Plan</p>
<p>Pilots shall continue to be permitted to participate in the Federal Express Corporation Group Legal Services Plan, under the same terms and conditions as other employees of the Company.</p>
<p>R.   MetPay</p>
<p>Pilots shall continue to be permitted to participate in the MetPay program, under the same terms and conditions as other employees of the Company.</p>
<p>S.   Adoption Program</p>
<p>Pilots shall be permitted to participate in the Adoption Program, under the same terms and conditions as other employees of the Company.</p>
<p>T.   Pilot Benefit Review Board</p>
<p>1. A Pilot Benefit Review Board (PBRB) shall be established for the Insurance Plans and the Retirement Plans described in Section 28. The Company and the Association shall agree to a Charter for the PBRB, to govern the procedures of the PBRB. The Charter shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement and shall comply with ERISA §503, “Claims Procedure,” and regulations of the Department of Labor thereunder.</p>
<p>2. The PBRB shall consist of an equal number of members appointed by the Company and members appointed by the Association. Each party shall appoint up to three members. Vacancies in the membership of the PBRB shall be filled by appointment of the respective parties. At any meeting of the PBRB, the Company and Association members may be accompanied by HIPAA trained individuals who the Company or Association members may deem appropriate. A claimant may not attend the PBRB sitting without a neutral member but may attend the PBRB sitting with a neutral member.</p>
<p>3. The PBRB may convene meetings at its discretion, or whenever a majority of the members of the PBRB make a written request for a meeting at least fourteen days prior to the meeting date.</p>
<p>4. The PBRB may convene meetings in person, by telephone conference, or by other electronic means as mutually agreed upon.</p>
<p>5. A claimant (pilot, former pilot, retired pilot, spouse, child or beneficiary) or authorized representative may appeal a claim which is denied through the claims and appeals process established by the claims paying administrator. Any claimant who seeks review by the PBRB must make a request in writing no later than one hundred twenty (120) days following the date on which a decision is rendered on appeal. The PBRB may, in its discretion, waive the one hundred twenty day period if circumstances warrant, in order to insure a full and fair review of a claimant’s claim. A claimant who requests a review by the PBRB shall have at least thirty (30) days from the date of his request to submit any written statement or other documentation for the PBRB’s consideration during its review. The PBRB is not required to conduct a formal hearing with respect to the review of any claim presented by a claimant.</p>
<p>6. A majority of the PBRB, sitting without a neutral member, shall constitute a quorum. Each member of the PBRB shall have one vote. In the event that one member is absent from a meeting, such member may give his proxy to another member. Proxies must be in writing.</p>
<p>7. A decision by majority vote shall be final and binding on all parties, and the PBRB shall issue a written decision within thirty (30) days after the vote.</p>
<p>8. In the event of a deadlock vote, the PBRB shall convene a meeting, which shall be chaired by a neutral arbitrator, to render its decision. The neutral arbitrator shall be selected from a panel of arbitrators designated jointly by the Company and the Association. Such panel shall be comprised of members of the National Academy of Arbitrators and experienced in both airline arbitration and pension or other relevant employee benefit issues. A decision by majority vote shall be final and binding on all parties, and the PBRB shall issue a written decision within thirty (30) days after the vote.</p>
<p>Should vacancies occur on the panel of neutral arbitrators, the parties shall attempt to agree on a replacement within thirty (30) days after the vacancy occurs. If the parties are unable to agree on a replacement, the vacancy shall remain unfilled unless there are too few arbitrators to preside over required meetings, in which case the parties may select an arbitrator by the alternative strike method from a list of arbitrators provided by the National Mediation Board who are members of the National Academy of Arbitrators to preside over scheduled meetings on an ad hoc basis.</p>

<h1 class="persist-header">Section 28: Retirement (Pension Benefits)</h1>
<p>A.   General</p>
<p>1. The Company shall continue to provide retirement and related benefits through the Retirement Plans and under the terms and conditions of the Retirement Plans, as in effect as of the date of signing of this Agreement, except as specifically provided herein. The terms and conditions of the Retirement Plans, insofar as they affect pilots, shall not be changed, except as provided in this Agreement or by the written agreement of the Association. The Pilot Benefit Book (“PBB”) shall be updated in accordance with <a href="#link_28A7" target="_blank">Section 28.A.7.</a> to reflect changes made by this Agreement and any other changes made pursuant to <a href="#link_28A5" target="_blank">Section 28.A.5.</a></p>
<p style="border-top:1px solid #0d0d0d;border-bottom:1px solid #0d0d0d;color:#999999;font-size:13px;">The following Retirement Plans are in effect as of November 2, 2015.<br/>

    (e) The Federal Express Corporation Non-Qualified Pension Plan for Pilots; and<br/>
    (f) The Federal Express Corporation Non-Qualified Section 415 Excess Pension Plan for Pilots.</p>
<p>2. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 28, the Company shall be responsible for the establishment, control, management, administration and attendant expenses of the Retirement Plans and all disputes concerning those claims for benefits shall be settled as described in <a href="#link_28A4" target="_blank">Section 28.A.4.</a></p>
<p>3. In order that the Association may have the most current information regarding the Retirement Plans, the Company shall provide the Association with the following documents:</p>

<p>The distribution schedule may be modified as agreed upon by the parties. The Association, and its designees, shall keep this information confidential, in accordance with the parties’ Confidentiality Agreement.</p>
<p>4. Review of benefit denials shall be as described in this Agreement, the Retirement Plans and the PBB. Benefit denials shall be reviewed by the FedEx Corporation Retirement Appeals Committee (“RAC”) or the appropriate claims-paying administrator. If the pilot is not satisfied with the decision regarding a Retirement Plan benefit, the pilot may seek review of the decision in accordance with the provisions of <a href="#link_28G" target="_blank">Section 28.G.</a> within 120 days of the RAC’s decision.</p>
<p>5. All of the Retirement Plans’ terms and conditions shall remain unchanged insofar as they affect pilots, except as specifically provided for herein or except as required by law. If an amendment to the Retirement Plans or the PBB is required by law, if there is more than one alternative available under the law with respect to such required amendment(s), and if the effectuation of either alternative would result in similar cost to the Company, the consent of the Association to one of the alternatives shall be required for such plan amendment. Such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Association’s consent shall not be required for any amendment described in this paragraph if more than one alternative is available under the law but the effectuation of one or more of the alternatives would result in increased cost to the Company over the other available alternatives.</p>
<p>6. The Company reserves the right to select the trustees, recordkeepers and other vendors it believes necessary to administer the Retirement Plans. The Company shall first notify and consult with the Association before changing a recordkeeper.</p>
<p>7. The Company shall promptly provide the Association with proposed updates to the PBB reflecting changes made by this Agreement. The Association shall promptly meet with the Company and provide comments. As soon as practicable thereafter, a PBB that is mutually satisfactory to the Company and the Association shall be distributed to the pilots. The Association’s approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, the failure of the Association to timely approve such updates shall not prevent the Company from distributing the updates to the pilots in accordance with the provisions of 29 U.S.C. §1024(b).</p>
<p>With respect to any future updates to the PBB, the Company shall prepare and distribute to the pilots updates to the PBB, as required by 29 U.S.C. §1024(b). The Association shall be given the opportunity to review and approve such updates; the Association’s approval of such updates shall not be unreasonably withheld. The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, the failure of the Association to timely approve such updates shall not prevent the Company from distributing the updates to the pilots in accordance with the provisions of 29 U.S.C. §1024(b).</p>
<p>8. The Company shall maintain records for a sufficient time and in sufficient detail to be able to confirm all data necessary for the calculation of any benefit payable under the Retirement Plans.</p>
<p>B.   Pension Plan</p>
<p>1. The terms and conditions of the FedEx Corporation Employees’ Pension Plan (“Pension Plan”) affecting pilots, the Federal Express Corporation Non-Qualified Pension Plan for Pilots (“Compensation Limit Plan”), and the Federal Express Corporation Non-Qualified Section 415 Excess Pension Plan for Pilots (“415 Limit Plan”) shall be as provided in the Pension Plan, the Compensation Limit Plan, and the 415 Limit Plan except as provided in this Agreement.</p>
<p>2. A pilot’s retirement benefit at his normal retirement date (the “Pension Plan Formula”) shall be equal to the greatest of:</p>
<p> (i) his final average earnings x 2% x credited years of service with the Company (Max. 25 years) for benefit accrual,</p>
<p style="margin-top:-20px;"> (ii) the benefit described in <a href="#link_28B4" target="_blank">Section 28.B.4.</a>, or </p>
<p>(iii) a flat dollar benefit based upon a pilot’s flight hours, equipment flown, and seat position during a plan year. The accrued benefit for a pilot who, prior to the merger of The Flying Tiger Line, Inc. (“FTL”) with the Company, was a participant in any of the FTL pension plans which were merged into the Pension Plan is determined as provided under the terms of the Pension Plan.</p>
<p>3. Final average earnings will be defined as the average of the highest five calendar years of compensation while working for the Company. In no event shall total final average earnings taken into account under the Pension Plan, the Compensation Limit Plan and the 415 Limit Plan exceed $260,000.</p>
<p>4. With respect to any pilot having a Master Seniority List number as of October 30, 2006, the benefit set forth in Section <a href="#link_28B2ii" target="_blank">28.B.2(ii)</a> of the Agreement shall be the sum of the amounts derived under the computations set forth in Section 28.B.4.a., b., and c.:</p>
<p>a.   For a pilot who had a Master Seniority List number as of June 1, 1999, and who also had a Master Seniority List number as of October 30, 2006, such pilot’s final average earnings shall be multiplied by past years of credited service with the Company as of June 1, 1999 (not to exceed a maximum of twenty-five years), multiplied by a multiplier from the following table based on such pilot’s years of vesting service with the Company:</p>

<!-- TODO                 -->
<!-- PENSION INFO REMOVED -->
<!-- TODO                 -->

<p>With respect to pilots who performed years of service with The Flying Tiger Line Inc. (“FTL”) prior to August 7, 1989, such pilot’s years of service with FTL shall be taken into account solely for purposes of determining the multiplier described herein, but shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining past years of credited service with the Company as of October 30, 2006.</p>
<p>d.   The Pension Plan was amended to incorporate the provisions of Section 28.B.4.a., Section 28.B.4.b. and Section 28.B.4.c. The parties agree that the provisions of Section 28.B.4.a., Section 28.B.4.b. and Section 28.B.4.c. were one-time amendments to the Pension Plan and those provisions applied only to the pilots entitled to a benefit under such provisions as of October 30, 2006. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, including the duration provisions contained in Section 31, Section 28.B.4.d. became effective on October 30, 2006, and has permanent duration, and neither the provisions of Section 28.B.4.d. nor the related provisions of the Pension Plan referenced herein may be altered without the written consent of both parties.</p>
<p>5. A pilot shall receive credited service for benefit accrual while on disability and while eligible for benefits, including Pilot Supplemental Disability benefits, pursuant to the terms of the LTD Plan.</p>
<p>6. For benefit commencement dates occurring on or after February 1, 2016, the following actuarially equivalent optional forms of benefit distributions shall also be available under the Pension Plan: 50% Joint and Survivor Pop-Up Annuity; 75% Joint and Survivor Pop-Up Annuity; and 100% Joint and Survivor Pop-Up Annuity.</p>
<p>7. The Pension Plan shall be amended effective no later than February 1, 2016, to allow a participant to elect different forms of benefit payment for his FTL benefit and for the remainder of his benefit under the Pension Plan.</p>
<p>8. The Pension Plan shall be amended effective no later than February 1, 2016, to provide that if:</p>
<p>a.   prior to his death, a pilot has retired and submitted a valid unexpired election to commence retirement benefits (within 90 days of the benefit commencement date (BCD)) as of the first day of the month following his retirement, and</p>
<p>b.   the pilot fails to survive until his elected BCD, then the pilot shall be deemed to have survived until his elected BCD and benefits shall commence on the elected BCD, in the form elected by the pilot, provided, however that the first benefit payment shall be paid to the pilot’s joint annuitant, beneficiary or estate, as applicable, pursuant to the form elected by the pilot. An election shall be determined to have been submitted prior to the pilot’s death, if there is proof that the election confirmation was mailed, emailed, faxed, posted or received by the administrator prior to the pilot’s death.</p>

<p>b.   On or after the date of the merger of the PMPPP into the PRSP, all non-elective Company contributions shall be made to the PRSP under <a href="#link_28D4" target="_blank">Section 28.D.4.</a> and shall cease to be made to the PMPPP.</p>
<p>3. The PMPPP shall be amended effective no later than March 2, 2016, to provide that a pilot shall be eligible for non-elective Company contributions based on eligible earnings on the first day of the month coincident with or next following one month of service from date of hire as a pilot. Company contributions will begin in the month the pilot first participates in the PMPPP, based on the pilot’s eligible monthly earnings in the month prior to participation, in the same manner as described in <a href="#link_28D6" target="_blank">Section 28.D.6.</a></p>
<p>4. On and after November 2, 2015, the investment fund options available to participants in the PMPPP will be the same as those available in the PRSP.</p>
<p>5. The PMPPP shall be amended effective no later than February 1, 2016, to allow a participant to make an in-service withdrawal of all or any portion of his account at or after age 62 under the PMPPP, subject to spousal consent as required by applicable law.</p>

<p>3. The PRSP shall be amended effective no later than January 1, 2017, to provide that the Company shall make matching contributions equal to 50% of the first $1,000 of employee pre-tax and Roth contributions (in the aggregate) per plan year.</p>
<p>4. Beginning on the date of the merger of the PMPPP into the PRSP, the Company shall contribute monthly for each eligible pilot an amount equal to 8% of that pilot’s eligible prior monthly earnings, to a non-elective Company contribution account for the participant under the PRSP, subject to the Code limitations. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company shall contribute monthly for each eligible pilot an amount equal to 9% of that pilot’s eligible prior monthly earnings, to a non-elective Company contribution account for the participant under the PRSP, subject to the Code limitations.</p>

<p>Example: For a pilot who is eligible to participate in the PRSP on July 1, 2017, the Company shall make a non-elective Company contribution to the PRSP on behalf of the pilot in July 2017, based on the pilot’s eligible monthly earnings for June, 2017.</p>
<p>7. All participants shall always be 100% vested in their accounts under the PRSP.</p>
<p>8. A pilot shall have allocated to his PRSP accounts such amounts as are attributable to unused sick leave, in accordance with the provisions of <a href="#link_14E" target="_blank">Section 14.E.</a> of this Agreement.</p>

Partial distributions and periodic distributions shall be made pro rata from all investment funds (excluding the brokerage account), unless the participant specifies a different allocation for the distribution(s).</p>
<p>18.    The PRSP shall be amended effective November 2, 2015, to provide that spousal consent is not required if the participant is legally separated from the spouse as evidenced by a court decree.</p>

<!-- SECTION 29 -->
<div class="four" id="section29">
<h1 class="persist-header">Section 29: Union Security and Checkoff</h1>
<p>A.   Conditions</p>
<p>1. As limited by the letter regarding Transition to Union Security dated August 26, 2006, each pilot covered by the Agreement who fails to acquire and maintain membership in the Association will be required, as a condition of continued employment, beginning 60 days following the completion of his probationary period, to pay to the Association each month a service charge as a contribution for the administration of the Agreement and the representation of the pilot. The Association has established that the service charge shall be an amount equal to the Association’s regular dues and periodic assessments. In calculation of each non-member’s monthly obligation, the Association will allocate and adjust charges in the same manner it followed with respect to its members.</p>
<p>2. The provisions of this Section will not apply to any pilot covered by the Agreement to whom membership in the Association is not available upon the same terms and conditions as are applicable to any other pilot, or to any pilot to whom membership in the Association was denied or terminated for any reason other than the failure of the pilot to pay initiation (or reinstatement) fee, dues and assessments uniformly required.</p>
<p>3. If a pilot covered by this Agreement is delinquent, or becomes delinquent in the payment of fees, dues and assessments or the service charge as stated in <a href="#link_29A1" target="_blank">Section 29.A.1.</a>, the Association will notify him with a copy to the Vice President, Flight Operations, or his designee, and the designated Company official in Labor Relations, that the pilot is delinquent and not complying with contract requirements and may be subject to separation from employment. Such letter will also notify the pilot that he must remit the required payment within a grace period of 15 days or risk being separated from employment.</p>
<p>4. If, upon the expiration of the 15 day grace period, the pilot remains delinquent, the following procedure shall be followed:</p>
<p>a.   The Association will give written notification to the Vice President, Flight Operations, or his designee, and the designated Company official in Labor Relations, with a copy to the pilot, that the pilot has failed to remit payment within the grace period and may be subject to separation from employment as a pilot. The Association’s notice will be accompanied by a packet of the letters sent to the pilot regarding the dues delinquency, and pilot responses to same, and along with all other relevant documentation in its possession regarding the delinquency matter.</p>
<p>b.   Upon receipt of such notification, the Vice President, Flight Operations, or his designee, and the designated Company official in Labor Relations, may require a meeting with the pilot and a representative of the Association. The Vice President, Flight Operations, or his designee, shall determine whether there was a compelling reason why the pilot remains delinquent in his dues. If no such reason exists, then the Vice President, or his designee, shall separate the pilot from employment. The existence of a compelling reason for the delinquency does not excuse the pilot from the obligation to rectify the delinquency; rather the Vice President, or his designee, shall propose an arrangement plan tailored to the specific situation, and if the pilot fails to agree to such plan, he shall be separated from employment.</p>
<p>c.   Within 30 days of receipt of such notification the Vice President, Flight Operations, or his designee, and the designated Company official in Labor Relations, will give the pilot written notification of his employment status as a pilot. Any separation will automatically be held in abeyance for 10 days from the postmark date of mailing of the notification. If the pilot files an appeal in accordance with <a href="#link_29A4di" target="_blank">Section 29.A.4.d.i.</a>, the separation will be further held in abeyance pending the exhaustion of the appeal process in this Section. A pilot who is sent a separation notice will be placed on an unpaid personal leave of absence until the appeal process is final.</p>
<p>d.   If the decision regarding the pilot’s employment status, including any separation from employment, is not satisfactory to either the pilot or the Association’s Vice President-Finance/Treasurer, either may file an appeal. Such appeal will be subject to the following procedure, which will be exclusive of the provisions of Sections 19, 20, and 21.</p>
<p>i. The appeal shall be sent to the Company, to the other party and to the National Mediation Board (NMB) within 10 days of the receipt of the decision and must contain a request for the NMB to provide a list of 7 neutral referees.</p>
<p>ii.    A neutral referee may be agreed upon by the pilot and the Association’s Legal Department Director within 20 days following the date of the NMB list of neutral referees. If the parties cannot agree on a neutral referee, within the same 20 day period, a neutral referee shall be chosen from the panel supplied by the NMB using the alternate strike method with the pilot initiating the first strike. If the parties have not reached a selection using the alternate strike method within the same 20 day period, the first name listed on the 7 name panel provided by the NMB shall be deemed the neutral referee.</p>
<p>iii.   The decision of the neutral referee will be requested within 30 days after the hearing of the appeal unless otherwise agreed by the pilot and the Association’s Legal Department Director and will be final and binding on all parties to the dispute. The fees, charges and other reasonable expenses of such neutral referee will be paid equally by the pilot and the Association.</p>
<p>5. The Company will be considered to have satisfied the requirements and standards for just cause discharge under this Agreement when a pilot is separated from employment under the provisions of this Section.</p>
<p>6. The Association agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold the Company harmless from any claims filed in any forum by or on behalf of any pilot relating to or arising out of any action taken by the Company pursuant to the terms of this Section.</p>
<p>7. Time limits and meeting dates set forth in this Section may be modified, orally or in writing, by agreement of the Company and ALPA. Oral agreements will be confirmed in writing as soon as practicable. Requests for modification of time limits or meeting dates will not be unreasonably denied.</p>
<p>8. The Association will provide the Company with written notice of any change in dues or assessment amounts as soon as practicable after such change is known.</p>
<p>9. Delivery of all notices, letters, decisions and appeals pursuant to <a href="#section29" target="_blank">Section 29</a> shall be made in person, by Federal Express Overnight Letter, by certified mail, return receipt requested or by other methods which provide verification of receipt. Notice to the Company shall be sent to the Vice President, Flight Operations, or his designee, and the designated Company official in Labor Relations, as set forth in the provisions of this Agreement. Notice to ALPA shall be sent to the Vice President - Finance, 535 Herndon Parkway, Herndon, VA 20170. Notice to pilots shall be sent to a pilot’s permanent, primary address. As provided in <a href="#link_26N2" target="_blank">Section 26.N.2.</a>, a pilot must keep his permanent, primary address current. Such information shall be shared electronically with the Association pursuant to <a href="#link_26R" target="_blank">Section 26.R.</a> and will be used for correspondence under this section. The notice of delinquency under this paragraph will be deemed to be received by the pilot on the fifth day after its postmark date of mailing, when mailed by the Association by Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested, or by FedEx Overnight Letter, to such pilot’s permanent, primary address.</p>
<p>B.   Check Off</p>
<p>1. The Company agrees to deduct from the pay of each employee covered by the Agreement, and remit to the Association promptly upon such deduction, membership dues, assessments by the Association, assessments by the FedEx MEC, insurance premiums, and service charges uniformly levied, in accordance with the Constitution and By-Laws of the Association, all as prescribed by the Railway Labor Act, as amended, provided such employee voluntarily executes authorization on a form (checkoff form) supplied by the Association. An example of such checkoff form is provided below. If technical or space limitations preclude a complete listing of all the itemized deductions on a pilot’s payroll stub, some Association deductions may be combined on the stub entry, if and where possible, or the parties may meet and consult to determine the appropriate method to satisfy the limitation problem.</p>
<p>2. All checkoff forms shall be submitted to the Association’s Membership and Council Services Department, which shall forward the original to the Company’s designated representative. Checkoff forms so received by the Company’s designated representative shall be stamp-dated on the date received and shall constitute notice to the Company on the date received and not when mailed. A properly executed checkoff form shall become effective as of the first payroll period of a calendar month commencing 15 days following its receipt by the Company. In accordance with applicable law, the Association will conform requests for payroll deductions to valid checkoff forms.</p>
<p>3. Any notice of revocation as set forth in the checkoff form must be in writing, signed by the pilot, and submitted to the Association’s Supervisor, Membership and Council Services Department by Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested, with a copy to the FedEx MEC Secretary-Treasurer. The Association’s Membership and Council Services Department shall forward the original to the Company’s designated representative. Notices of revocation are effective as of the first payroll period of a calendar month commencing 15 days following receipt of such revocation by the Association.</p>
<p>4. The Company shall collect dues and assessments from pilots who elected dues and assessments checkoff in the paychecks issued on the 15th and last day of each month and any “off-cycle” paychecks. Following the processing of payroll on the 15th and last day of each month, the Company shall remit to the Association the funds collected pursuant to this provision since the previous remittance.</p>
<p>5. The Company shall forward an electronic record of each deduction type (dues, assessments, service charges (not including assessments), insurance premiums, and arrangement plans). The record shall identify the date of the covered payroll period, each pilot for whom an Association-related deduction was made, each pilot’s employee number, and the amount of each pilot’s deduction. The electronic record for dues and service charge deductions shall also include the amount of a pilot’s earnings during the current payroll cycle that are subject to dues.</p>
<p>6. A pilot’s checkoff form shall be deemed to have been revoked effective upon:</p>
<p>a.   such pilot’s resignation or termination from Company employment as a pilot; or</p>
<p>b.   such pilot’s furlough pursuant to Section 23; or</p>
<p>c.   the Company’s receipt of a pilot’s written notice of revocation as provided in <a href="#link_29B3" target="_blank">Section 29.B.3.</a></p>
<p>Further deductions for such pilot, if any, shall be made only upon execution and receipt of another checkoff form, except that a furloughee shall have deductions begin again upon his return to active service, unless he provides written notice of revocation as provided above.</p>
<p>7. This Agreement shall not be construed to revoke or cancel any FedEx checkoff form executed prior to the effective date of the Agreement.</p>
<p>8. Collection of any back dues owed at the time of starting deductions for any employee, collection of dues missed because the employee’s earnings were not sufficient to cover the payment of dues in the specified pay period and dues owed because of errors by ALPA in the accounting procedure will be the responsibility of the Association and not the Company. The Association will make every effort to verify apparent errors with the individual Association member or pilot employee before contacting the Company’s designated representative for dues and service charge deduction issues. In cases where a deduction is made which duplicates a payment already made to the Association by an employee, or where a deduction is not in conformity with the provisions of the Association’s Constitution and By-Laws or <a href="#section29" target="_blank">Section 29</a> of this Agreement, refunds to the employees will be made by the Association.</p>
<p>C.   Annual Income</p>
<p>On an annual basis and within 45 days of the end of each calendar year, the Company will furnish the FedEx MEC Secretary-Treasurer and the Association’s Supervisor, Membership and Council Services Department with an electronic compilation of the annual income for each pilot who, as limited by the letter regarding Transition to Union Security dated August 26, 2006, and <a href="#link_29A2" target="_blank">Section 29.A.2.</a>, is subject to this provision.</p>

<p>2. An interpretation of a term of the parties’ predecessor collective bargaining agreement (including the Letters of Agreement and Memoranda of Understanding listed in <a href="#link_31A1" target="_blank">Section 31.A.1.</a> above) remains in effect as part of this Agreement (subject to the durational terms, if any, of the document(s) memorializing such interpretation(s)) if (i) such term is not materially changed in this Agreement and (ii):</p>
<p>a.   The interpretation was set forth in, and was necessary to the holding of, a grievance award; or</p>
<p>b.   A mutually agreed interpretation was set forth in a written grievance settlement to which the Company and Association are parties; or</p>
<p>c.   A mutually agreed interpretation was set forth in a written agreement to which the Company and the Association are parties.</p>
<p>B.   Subsequent Agreements</p>
<p>An agreement between the Company and Association entered into after execution of this Agreement affecting rates of pay, rules, or working conditions of a pilot will be effective only if in writing and signed by authorized representatives of the Company and the Association.</p>
<p>C.   Effective Date and Duration</p>
<p>1. Except as expressly provided below or elsewhere in this Agreement or in the Implementation and Transition Letter of Agreement, this Agreement shall become effective on November 2, 2015 (the first day of the November 2015 bid period), and shall continue in full force and effect through the last day of the October 2021 bid period and shall renew itself without change through the end of each October bid period thereafter, unless written notice of intended change is served in accordance with Section 6, Title I of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, by either party hereto at least 30 days but not more than 180 days prior to the last day of the October 2021 bid period or the last day of the October bid period in any year thereafter.</p>
<p>2. Notwithstanding the duration clause set forth in <a href="#link_31C1" target="_blank">Section 31.C.1.</a> above, either party may, at its election, exercise early reopening of this Agreement if, during the term of this Agreement, the Company becomes subject to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) flight and duty time regulations that have a material, adverse impact on the Company’s costs.</p>
<p>a.   In order for the Company to reopen the Agreement early pursuant to <a href="#link_31C2" target="_blank">Section 31.C.2.</a>, the Company must deliver written notice of early reopening to the Association’s MEC Chairman. In order for the Association to reopen the Agreement early pursuant to <a href="#link_31C2" target="_blank">Section 31.C.2.</a>, the Association must deliver written notice of early reopening to the Vice President, Labor Relations.

<p align="center">and</p>
<p align="center">THE AIR LINE PILOTS</p>
<p align="center">in the service of</p>
<p align="center">FEDERAL EXPRESS CORPORATION</p>
<p align="center">as represented by</p>
<p align="center">THE AIR LINE PILOTS ASSOCIATION, INTERNATIONAL</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">FOREIGN DUTY ASSIGNMENTS IN THE EMEA AND HKG</p>
<p>This Letter of Agreement (“LOA”) is made and entered into in accordance with the provisions of Title II of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, by and between FEDERAL EXPRESS CORPORATION (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”) and the pilots in the service of FEDERAL EXPRESS CORPORATION, as represented by the AIR LINE PILOTS ASSOCIATION, INTERNATIONAL (hereinafter referred to as the “Association”).</p>
<p>WHEREAS, the Company and the Association are parties to a collective bargaining agreement setting forth the rates of pay, rules, and working conditions for the Company’s pilots (hereinafter referred to as the “basic Agreement”), effective on November 2, 2015, and</p>
<p>WHEREAS, the Company and the Association agree that the following terms and conditions shall govern Foreign Duty Assignments (<a id="_idTextAnchor475"></a>hereinafter referred to as “FDAs<a id="_idTextAnchor476"></a>”) in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region (hereinafter referred to as “EMEA”) and Hong Kong (hereinafter referred to as “HKG”).</p>
<p>NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:</p>
<p>A. Authorized FDAs and Establishing a New FDA in the EMEA</p>
<p>1. This LOA authorizes the Company to center FDAs in:</p>
<p>a. Hong Kong (HKG);</p>
<p>b. Cologne, Germany (CGN); and</p>
<p>c. Paris, France (CDG), provided, however, that if the Company establishes an FDA in CDG under this LOA, the housing allowance shall be determined in accordance with Paragraph A.2.d. of this LOA below.</p>
<p>2. The Company may establish a new FDA in the EMEA, if agreed upon in writing by the Association’s MEC Chairman and the Vice President of Flight Operations under the following conditions:</p>
<p>a. The Company shall notify the Association’s MEC Chairman, in writing, of the location and anticipated date the Company plans to begin staffing the FDA.</p>
<p>b. The FDA is centered at an airport located in Switzerland, <a id="_idTextAnchor494"></a>Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Spain, the Netherlands, or Belgium.</p>
<p>c. The location is determined to be acceptable from a safety, security, and accessibility standpoint.</p>
<p>d. A housing allowance is provided to pilots assigned to the FDA that is not less than $3,500, which shall be adjusted for the difference in the cost-of-living between CGN and the location of the new FDA, as follows:</p>
<p>i. The Baseline Maximum Per Diem Rate (BMPDR) for the CGN FDA (as defined in Paragraph C.2.d.i.(c) of this LOA) and the Maximum Per Diem Rate (MPDR) for the new EMEA FDA location shall be sampled on the date the Company notifies the Association that it plans to establish a new EMEA FDA.</p>
<p>ii.    The initial housing allowance in the new EMEA FDA location shall be based on the ratio between the most recent housing allowance in the CGN FDA and the corresponding BMPDR for CGN, when compared to the MPDR for the new EMEA FDA location (rounded to the nearest whole dollar).</p>
<p>iii.   The minimum monthly housing allowance for the new EMEA FDA location shall be based on the ratio between the MPDR in the CGN FDA and the MPDR in the new EMEA FDA location, when compared to $3,500 (rounded to the nearest whole dollar).</p>
<p>e. The terms and conditions of this LOA applicable to the FDA centered in CGN shall apply to a new EMEA FDA.</p>
<p>3. Provided that the prerequisites of Paragraph A.2. of this LOA are satisfied, the Association’s agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Company shall have the burden of proof and persuasion in a proceeding in which this provision is contested.</p>
<p>4.   Nothing in this LOA shall be construed to limit the Company’s ability to establish an FDA in accordance with Section 6 of the basic Agreement.</p>
<p>B. Crew Posistions in FDAs</p>
<p>Crew Positions for FDAs in the EMEA or in HKG shall be posted, bid upon and awarded as provided in Section 24 of the basic Agreement with the following modifications:</p>
<p>1. In any notification of a System Bid, the Company shall also include any known restriction related to the EMEA or HKG FDAs.</p>
<p>2. The down/lateral bid restrictions set forth in <a href="#link_24F1" target="_blank">Section 24.F.1.</a> of the basic Agreement shall be waived with respect to pilots bidding for FDA crew positions.</p>
<p>3. In order to list an FDA crew position on his standing bid, a pilot must sign an FDA Personal Agreement (hereinafter “Personal Agreement”), agreed upon by the parties (Attachment A), which provides, in part, that, if the pilot is awarded an FDA crew position, the terms and conditions of his employment while assigned to the FDA will be governed by the basic Agreement and applicable laws of the United States and not by the laws of the country where the FDA is located.</p>
<p>a. Pilots listing an FDA crew position on their standing bid will be provided with an electronic copy of the Personal Agreement, which the pilot must sign and submit electronically to the Company.</p>
<p>b. If an FDA pilot violates any aspect of the FDA Personal Agreement:</p>
<p>i. The pilot may, at the Company’s option, be assigned to a non-FDA crew position consistent with the pilot’s seniority. Such pilot’s assignment (as that term is defined in Section 24) to a non-FDA crew position and/or his assignment (as that term is defined in Section 24) to an ITU training date/slot (if any such training is required) shall not generate an SDP or an inverse SDP for any pilot.</p>
<p>ii. Nothing in this Paragraph shall be construed so as to limit any action the Company might take under Sections 19, 20, and 21 related to a pilot’s violation of the Personal Agreement.</p>
<p>4. Visas and Other Required Credentials</p>
<p>a. The Company shall cover the cost of obtaining visas and other official credentials that are required for an FDA pilot (i.e., a pilot activated in an FDA crew position) to live and/or work in the FDA (e.g., residence and work visas, HKG Identification Card, etc.).</p>
<p>i.   To the extent that members of the pilot’s immediate family (as that term is defined in Section 6 of the basic Agreement) relocate with him to the FDA, the Company shall also cover the cost of such visas and other official credentials that are required for those members of the pilot’s immediate family to live in the FDA.</p>
<p>Absent extenuating circumstances, if the Company obtains such visas and credentials for members of the pilot’s immediate family who do not relocate to the FDA thereafter, the pilot shall reimburse the Company for the cost of obtaining such visas and credentials.</p>
<p>ii.  Pilots shall coordinate and cooperate with the Company’s designated representatives for the purpose of securing said visas and credentials.</p>
<p>b. If, having been awarded an FDA crew position, a pilot is unable to secure or maintain any required visa or credentials for himself, he shall contact his Fleet Captain immediately and shall be released from his FDA crew position award.</p>
<p>c. If a member of the pilot’s immediate family is unable to secure or maintain the required visas or credentials, the pilot may elect to be released from his FDA crew position award by submitting an appropriate explanation to the System Chief Pilot (or his designee). The timing of the release shall be determined by the System Chief Pilot (or his designee), after consultation with the pilot, and shall balance the pilot’s desires with the Company’s operational requirements.</p>
<p>d. The crew position of a pilot who was released from his FDA crew position award as described in Paragraph B.4.c. of this LOA shall be determined as provided in <a href="#link_13A6bii" target="_blank">Section 13.A.6.b.ii.</a> of the basic Agreement as if the pilot had been on a leave of absence when the System Bid on which he was awarded his FDA crew position closed. Such pilot’s assignment (as that term is defined in Section 24) to a new crew position and assignment (as that term is defined in Section 24) to an ITU training date/slot (if any such training is required) shall not generate an SDP or an inverse SDP for any pilot.</p>
<p>e. The pilot’s inability to secure or maintain required visas or credentials shall not, by itself, constitute grounds for penalty or discipline.</p>
<p>C. Relocation Package Options in the EMEA and HKG FDAs</p>
<p>Except as provided in Paragraph O. of this LOA within 15 days after being awarded a crew position in an FDA, a pilot shall choose from either the “Existing CBA Option” or the “Enhanced Option” set forth in Paragraph C.1. and C.2. of this LOA, respectively.</p>
<p>1. Existing CBA Option (3 year commitment)</p>
<p>Pilots who choose the Existing CBA Option shall be entitled to the following:</p>
<p>a. Relocation benefits as described in Section 6 of the basic Agreement, except that <a href="#link_6E1e" target="_blank">Section 6.E.1.e.</a> (FDA Bonus) shall be inapplicable.</p>
<p>b. Tax equalization as provided in Paragraph E. of this LOA.</p>
<p>2. Enhanced Option (2 year commitment)</p>
<p>Pilots selecting the Enhanced Option shall be entitled to the following benefits, in lieu of the benefits available under Section 6 of the basic Agreement. Unless specifically provided for below, provisions in Section 6 of the basic Agreement shall not be applicable to HKG and EMEA FDA pilots who elect the Enhanced Option.</p>
<p>a. Seed Money</p>
<p>Pilots who select the enhanced option shall be entitled to a one-time payment of <a id="_idTextAnchor531"></a>$10,000 which shall be paid upon:</p>
<p>i. a pilot’s activation into his FDA crew position; and</p>
<p>ii. the Company’s receipt of all required documentation, including documentation required for the processing of the tax equalization program and all necessary immigration paperwork.</p>
<p>b. Four Year Service Credit</p>
<p>If a pilot completes 48 months as an active pilot in the same FDA, he shall receive an additional payment of $5,000. This payment shall be made within 30 days after the pilot completes his 48th month as an active pilot in the FDA. If a pilot upgrades within the FDA, time spent in ITU training will not be counted toward the 48 months. A pilot may receive more than one 48 month service credit payment during his assignment to the FDA (e.g., if a HKG FDA pilot completes 96 months as an active pilot in the HKG FDA, he shall receive a second payment of $5,000, etc.).</p>
<p>c. Storage</p>
<p>i. A pilot shall be entitled to expenses associated with the storage of his household goods in the location of his pre-FDA domestic residence (i.e., his permanent, primary residence immediately preceding his assignment to the FDA) or, if approved in advance by the Relocation Department, a different domestic location involving no greater cost to the Company (using the cost of storage in the pilot’s pre-FDA domestic location as the reference point). Reimbursement shall not exceed $4,000 per year and the storage must be at a commercial storage provider. In addition, the Company will assume the cost of packing such goods (subject to the standard limitations regarding the types of goods to be shipped/stored, which are catalogued in <a href="#link_6C1b" target="_blank">Section 6.C.1.b.</a>), and the cost of transporting them to and from the storage facility (local transportation only). Requests for reimbursement of storage fees must be submitted within 90 days of the date the expense was incurred, in accordance with the Company’s standard procedures concerning expense reporting.</p>
<p>ii.  A pilot may elect to waive reimbursement of domestic storage expenses and instead elect to ship up to 2,000 additional pounds of household goods in his initial and return household goods shipments pursuant to Paragraph C.2.h. of this LOA. This election shall be made during the pilot’s “FDA Assignment Window” (i.e., the period beginning 60 days prior to his activation in his FDA crew position and ending 6 months after his activation in his FDA crew position) and shall apply for the duration of the pilot’s assignment to the FDA.</p>
<p>d. Housing Allowance</p>
<p>i. Rental Allowance</p>
<p>Pilots shall be entitled to a rental allowance as set forth below to offset the cost of renting a permanent, primary residence in the FDA location.</p>
<p>(a) The monthly rental allowance in the HKG FDA shall be a minimum of $4,500.</p>
<p>(b) The monthly rental allowance in the FDA centered in CGN shall be a minimum of $3,500.</p>
<p>(c) Cost of Living Protection for EMEA FDA Rental Allowance</p>
<p>(1) The U.S. Department of State Foreign Maximum Per Diem Rate (MPDR) for the CGN FDA was sampled on March 1, 2011, which established the Baseline Maximum Per Diem Rate (BMPDR) of 388.</p>
<p>(2)  Beginning on January 1 and July 1 of each calendar year following the effective date of this Agreement, the MPDR shall be sampled. If the sampled MPDR varies from the BMPDR by more than 5%, the Company shall adjust the EMEA FDA Rental Allowance by the percentage change in the MPDR (rounded to the nearest whole dollar). If the EMEA FDA Rental Allowance is changed pursuant to this mechanism, the MPDR on which the new housing allowance was based shall constitute the new BMPDR, which shall be published on the EUR FDA page of pilot.fedex.com.</p>
<p>(3)  Any adjustment to the EMEA FDA Rental Allowance by operation of this paragraph shall be effective beginning in February and/or August, and shall be announced via FCIF at least 15 days prior to the first business day of February and/or August.</p>
<p>(4)  In no event, however, shall the application of this paragraph result in a monthly rental allowance for the EMEA FDA of less than that set forth in Paragraph C.2.d.i.(b) of this LOA.</p>
<p>(d)    Cost of Living Protection for HKG FDA Rental Allowance</p>
<p>(1)  On the effective date of this Agreement, the Company shall calculate a baseline Currency Exchange Rate Adjusted Rental Index (CERARI), as follows:</p>
<p>(A)    The most recent, non-provisional Private Domestic – Class C Rental Index (prepared by the Rating and Valuation Department of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) (RI) shall be sampled. This shall be the “baseline RI.”</p>
<p>(B)    The “Average Buying Rate in Hong Kong Dollars” (published by the Inland Revenue Department of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) (ABR) for the month used to determine the baseline RI shall also be sampled. This shall be the “baseline ABR.”</p>
<p>(C)    The baseline RI shall be divided by the baseline ABR to determine the baseline CERARI, which shall be published on the HKG FDA page of pilot.fedex.com.</p>
<p>(2)  Beginning on January 1 and July 1 of each calendar year following the effective date of this Agreement, the Company shall calculate a new CERARI using the same methodology set forth in Paragraph C.2.d.i.(d)(1). If the calculated CERARI on that day varies from the baseline CERARI by more than 5%, the Company shall adjust the HKG FDA Rental Allowance by the percentage change in the CERARI (rounded to the nearest whole dollar). If the HKG FDA Rental Allowance is adjusted pursuant to this mechanism, the CERARI on which the adjusted HKG FDA Rental Allowance was based shall constitute the new baseline CERARI, which shall also be published on the HKG FDA page of pilot.fedex.com.</p>
<p>(3)  Any adjustment to the HKG FDA Rental Allowance by operation of this paragraph shall be effective beginning in February and/or August, and shall be announced via FCIF at least 15 days prior to the first business day of February and/or August.</p>
<p>(4)  In no event, however, shall the application of this paragraph result in a monthly rental allowance for the HKG FDA of less than that set forth in Paragraph C.2.d.i.(a) of this LOA, nor shall the application of this paragraph result in a CERARI less than the baseline CERARI determined on the effective date of this Agreement.</p>
<p>ii.  Home Ownership Allowance. A pilot who chooses to own rather than rent a permanent, primary residence in the FDA shall be entitled to a monthly home ownership allowance of 50% of the minimum FDA rental housing allowance listed in Paragraph C.2.d.i.(a) and (b) of this LOA.</p>
<p>iii. To be eligible for the housing allowance, a pilot must establish and maintain a permanent, primary residence in the country containing the airport at which the FDA base is centered (for purposes of this paragraph, HKG shall be considered part of China). Additionally, the pilot must occupy the housing for which an allowance is being paid. Standards for determining whether a pilot has relocated his permanent, primary residence under this paragraph shall be the same as for full relocations under Section 6 of the basic Agreement. The housing must be located within 100 nautical miles of the base airport. A larger radius may be approved on a case-by-case basis by the System Chief Pilot, if the proposed residence affords access to the hub airport that is at least as expeditious and reliable as comparable residences inside the 100 nm radius and is within the same country in which the FDA base airport is located.</p>
<p>Note: The requirement that pilots establish and maintain a permanent, primary residence in the country containing the airport at which the FDA base is located shall not apply to pilots who elected the Enhanced Option and who relocated their permanent, primary residence to within 100 nm of the FDA base airport prior to February 28, 2011.</p>
<p>iv. The housing allowance shall be paid the first month in which the pilot is assigned to the FDA and has secured a permanent, primary residence pursuant to Paragraph C.2.d.iii. of this LOA. In the first and last month of a pilot’s assignment to the FDA, if the pilot is assigned to the FDA for less than a full month, his housing allowance for that month(s) shall be prorated.</p>
<p>Upon request, a pilot must provide adequate substantiation that he has established and maintained his permanent, primary residence in the FDA, including, but not limited to, a lease agreement, canceled checks, or receipts.</p>
<p>v. In cases of a pilot’s persistent failure to maintain timely contact and completion of required documentation pertaining to the tax equalization program, the Company may suspend the pilot’s housing allowance, provided however, that the Company gave the pilot prior notice of his delinquency and the pilot was given at least 60 days to rectify that delinquency.</p>
<p>vi.  The pilot shall receive a pro-rated FDA housing allowance for 30 days after the date on which:</p>
<p>(a)  the pilot’s lease on his permanent, primary residence in the FDA expires (or is not renewed within 15 days of its expiration) or is terminated prior to its expiration date by the pilot or the pilot’s landlord;</p>
<p>(b)  the pilot ships his household goods from the FDA to his next residence in accordance with Paragraph C.2.h.ii. of this LOA; or</p>
<p>(c)  the pilot uses or members of his immediate family use the Company provided de-positioning tickets to travel to the pilot’s next residence in accordance with Paragraph C.2.f. of this LOA.</p>
<p>A pilot is not eligible for FDA housing allowance payment(s) (full or pro-rated) after his activation in his new crew position.</p>
<p>e. Tax equalization as provided in Paragraph E. of this LOA.</p>
<p>f. Airline Tickets. All airline tickets authorized by this paragraph shall be purchased exclusively through the Company’s travel vendor in coordination with the Relocation Department.</p>
<p>i.   The Company shall provide business class air travel to the pilot and the members of his immediate family relocating to the FDA with him:</p>
<p>(a)    to the FDA base airport from his pre-FDA domestic residence during his FDA Assignment Window (“positioning air travel”); and</p>
<p>(b)    from the FDA base airport (or a commercial passenger airport within 100 nm of the FDA base airport) to one of the following locations during his “FDA Transition Window” (i.e., the period beginning 6 months prior to his activation into his post-FDA crew position and ending upon either his activation in his new crew position or 60 days after termination of his employment, whichever is earlier) (“de-positioning air travel”):</p>
<p>(1)  his pre-FDA domestic residence;</p>
<p>(2)  his new base, if the pilot is relocating his permanent, primary residence to his new base; or</p>
<p>(3)  his new residence if located in a different location in the US involving no greater cost to the Company (using his pre-FDA domestic residence as the reference point).</p>
<p>ii.    After the completion of his commitment period in the FDA, the Company shall provide the pilot and the members of his immediate family who relocated to the FDA and have been living with the pilot in the FDA during his commitment period with economy class round trip air travel once per calendar year from the FDA base airport (or a commercial passenger airport within 100 nm of the FDA base airport) to one of the following locations (“annual home visit air travel”):</p>
<p>(a)    his pre-FDA domestic residence; or</p>
<p>(b)    a different domestic location involving no greater cost to the Company (using the pilot’s pre-FDA domestic residence as the reference point).</p>
<p>iii.  The Company shall establish a separate FDA air travel expense bank for each pilot entitled to airline tickets authorized by Paragraph C.2.f. The value of the pilot’s FDA air travel expense bank shall be equal to the reference fare quote obtained by the Company’s travel vendor pursuant to Paragraph C.2.f.iii.(b).</p>
<p>(a)    A pilot shall submit his positioning or de-positioning air travel request to the Relocation Department at least 21 days prior to the requested travel date. A pilot shall submit his annual home visit air travel request as far in advance as is practicable under the pilot’s circumstances (e.g., requesting travel following bid period schedule awards or secondary line construction).</p>
<p>Note: The Company currently requires, and may continue to require, the pilot to submit an air travel request form to the Relocation Department in order to access this benefit.</p>
<p>(b) Within 3 days of the Relocation Department’s receipt of the pilot’s request for air travel authorized by this paragraph, the Company’s travel vendor shall obtain a fare quote (“reference fare quote”) for the total cost of business class (for positioning/de-positioning tickets) or economy class (for annual home visit tickets) air travel for the pilot’s entire traveling party between the reference destinations listed in Paragraph C.2.f.i. and ii. respectively. The Company’s travel vendor shall transmit the reference fare quote electronically to the Company’s Relocation and Crew Travel Audit Departments and to the pilot.</p>
<p>(c)    Within 3 days of the pilot’s request for air travel authorized by this paragraph, the Company’s travel vendor shall also obtain a fare quote (“requested fare quote”) for the total cost of air travel for the pilot’s entire traveling party on the requested itinerary. The Company’s travel vendor shall transmit the requested fare quote electronically to the pilot, at which time the pilot may purchase tickets for his requested itinerary (as quoted) or make alternative arrangements with the Company’s travel vendor.</p>
<p>(d)    If the pilot elects to travel on the “reference” itinerary, the pilot must purchase tickets from the Company’s travel vendor within 3 days of the pilot’s receipt of the reference fare quote.</p>
<p>(e)    Any air travel expenses in excess of the balance of the pilot’s FDA air travel expense bank shall be remitted to the Company by payroll deduction, as provided in <a href="#link_3E1avi" target="_blank">Section 3.E.1.a.vi.</a>, from the pay check on the 15th of the month following the pilot’s purchase of air travel tickets authorized by this paragraph.</p>
<p>g. Commitment Period</p>
<p>i. A pilot must complete two years as an active pilot in the FDA, unless released from his obligation due to extenuating circumstances by the Vice President, Flight Operations.</p>
<p>ii. If a pilot fails to complete his commitment period without a release from the Vice President, Flight Operations, he shall be obligated to repay his seed money and any money paid by the Company for storage.</p>
<p>iii. If a pilot changes or attempts to change his crew status within his FDA (e.g., upgrades from F/O/HKG to CAP/HKG), his original commitment period shall be extended by 12 months plus the time spent in training. In the EMEA FDA, however, a pilot may change his crew status in this manner only if the pilot can activate to the new seat and actually perform revenue operations in that seat for at least <a id="_idTextAnchor556"></a>12 months prior to the end of his EMEA FDA assignment. This restriction may be waived by the Vice President, Flight Operations, in extenuating circumstances.</p>
<p>An extension of an FDA pilot’s commitment period under this provision shall not be considered for purposes of determining a pilot’s eligibility for annual home visit air travel benefits (Paragraph C.2.f.ii.) (i.e., the pilot’s “original” commitment period shall be used to determine his eligibility for annual home visit air travel benefits – not the pilot’s “extended” commitment period).</p>
<p>iv. Furlough or Assignment</p>
<p>In the event that an FDA pilot is furloughed or assigned (as that term is defined in Section 24) to a crew position and that pilot has contractual obligations associated with his rented permanent, primary residence (e.g., lease, utilities, mobile phone, internet, cable/television, and telephone) in the FDA that extend beyond his furlough date or his activation into his new crew position, the Company shall assume responsibility for reasonable and customary termination fees; provided, however, that the pilot provides the Company with a copy of any relevant agreement(s), has taken reasonable steps to mitigate or reduce the termination fees, and has fully cooperated with the Company in this regard.</p>
<p>In addition, the Company shall reimburse educational expenses that the furloughed pilot is responsible for beyond the furlough date. Educational expenses for an FDA pilot assigned (as that term is defined in Section 24) to a crew position are subject to the provisions in Paragraph G.2. of this LOA.</p>
<p>In the event that an FDA pilot is furloughed or assigned (as that term is defined in Section 24) to a crew position in a different geographic location, he shall be entitled to the relocation benefits set forth in <a href="#link_6E2bii" target="_blank">Section 6.E.2.b.ii.</a> or <a href="#link_6E2biii" target="_blank">iii.</a> of the basic Agreement (as appropriate).</p>
<p>h. Household Goods Shipments</p>
<p>i.   Initial Household Goods Shipment</p>
<p>During an FDA pilot’s FDA Assignment Window, he shall be entitled to a household goods shipment of 2,000 lbs. (or 4,000 lbs. if the pilot elected to waive reimbursement of domestic storage expenses pursuant to Paragraph C.2.c. of this LOA) from his pre-FDA domestic residence to his permanent, primary residence in the FDA. A pilot’s initial household goods shipment shall be via FedEx Express International Economy (IE) service (or the most comparable such service if IE is discontinued).</p>
<p>ii.  Return Household Goods Shipment</p>
<p>During an FDA pilot’s FDA Transition Window, he shall be eligible for a household goods shipment of 4,000 lbs. (or 6,000 lbs. if the pilot elected to waive reimbursement of domestic storage expenses pursuant to Paragraph C.2.c. of this LOA). A pilot’s return household goods shipment shall be via either FedEx Express, on a space available basis, or by surface transportation if surface transportation offers more expeditious transit times than shipment by FedEx Express on a space available basis.</p>
<p>Unless different locations are authorized by the Company’s Relocation Department, return household goods shipments shall be, at the pilot’s option, from the pilot’s permanent, primary residence in the FDA to:</p>
<p>(a)    his pre-FDA domestic residence;</p>
<p>(b)    his new base, if the pilot is relocating his permanent, primary residence to his new base; or</p>
<p>(c)    his new residence if located in a different location in the US involving no greater cost to the Company (using his pre-FDA domestic residence as the baseline).</p>
<p>If a pilot chooses a location which exceeds the cost to the Company of shipping the pilot’s household goods from his permanent, primary residence in the FDA to his pre-FDA domestic residence, the pilot shall be responsible for the additional cost of shipping to that location. This provision shall not limit or abridge any relocation rights which accrued to the pilot prior to his FDA assignment (e.g., rights accrued by SFS and ANC pilots under 1999 and 2006 Agreements).</p>
<p>iii. For all household goods shipments, this benefit shall include the cost of packing such goods, subject to the standard limitations regarding the types of goods to be shipped/stored, which are catalogued in <a href="#link_6C1b" target="_blank">Section 6.C.1.b.</a> of the basic Agreement, and the cost of transporting them as described above.</p>
<p>iv.  For shipments of household goods by air, the pilot shall be responsible for the cost of shipping any excess dimensional weight if the dimensional weight exceeds both the actual weight and the maximum weight allowance. The dimensional weight for such shipments is calculated by multiplying the actual volume of the shipment (in cu. ft.) by 4.0 lbs./cu. ft.</p>
<p>v.   Payment for any excess weight over the applicable weight limits or additional shipment costs associated with the destination of his household goods shipment shall be the sole responsibility of the pilot and shall be paid at the time of the move.</p>
<p>vi.  Delayed household goods shipments shall be handled in accordance with <a href="#link_6C1a" target="_blank">Section 6.C.1.a.</a> of the basic Agreement.</p>
<p>vii. Regardless of whether the pilot elected the Enhanced Option or the Existing CBA Option, the Company shall reimburse the pilot for the cost of a shipment of personal items (up to 100 lbs., but no more than $500) after the pilot’s household goods are shipped from the FDA; provided, however, that the pilot ships his personal items using his FedEx employee discount/reduced-rate shipping account and submits a receipt/invoice within 30 days of the date of the shipment.</p>
<p>i. In the event the Company closes an FDA, pilots who have not met their commitment period shall not be required to repay any seed money or monies paid by the Company for storage and shall be permitted to a return household goods shipment in accordance with Paragraph C.2.h.ii. of this LOA.</p>
<p>j. Orientation and Housing Search Services</p>
<p>i. During the first 30 days of a pilot’s assignment to the FDA, the Company shall make available to FDA pilots local real estate and orientation assistance. This shall be provided through individuals who are fluent in the local language and who are familiar with the FDA location. This service may last up to four days and may be provided individually or in small groups.</p>
<p>ii. In extraordinary circumstances, an additional day(s) may be approved by the Vice President, Flight Operations, or his designee. Any additional day(s) not approved by the Company shall be at the pilot’s expense. A pilot may use his Company credit card to pay for any additional day(s) and the amount of the expenditure will be recovered through payroll deduction as provided in <a href="#link_3E1aiv" target="_blank">Section 3.E.1.a.iv.</a> of the basic Agreement.</p>
<p>iii. The Company shall provide 6 months of ongoing telephonic support beginning the first day of onsite housing assistance provided to the pilot. This shall be provided through individuals who are fluent in the local language and who are familiar with the FDA location.</p>
<p>k. Initial Residence upon Arrival</p>
<p>i. During the first 30 days of a pilot’s assignment to the EMEA FDA, he may be required to stay, at the Company’s expense, in an extended stay hotel that has been jointly approved by the Company and the Association. To the extent that the daily cost of the hotel stay is less than $250, the Company will pay the pilot the difference between the cost of the hotel stay and $250.</p>
<p>ii.  Pilots assigned to the HKG FDA (or the EMEA FDA if the pilots are not so required pursuant to Paragraph C.2.k.i. of this LOA) may elect to live in a local hotel for up to 30 nights in the first 60 days of his assignment. The Company will reimburse pilots making this election for the cost of hotel arrangements up to $250 per night.</p>
<p>iii. In extraordinary circumstances, the Vice President, Flight Operations, or his designee, may approve additional days of hotel usage for pilots in the<a id="_idTextAnchor572"></a> FDA.</p>
<p>iv. Payments for hotel stays pursuant to these provisions are in lieu of the housing allowance set forth in Paragraph C.2.d. of this LOA.</p>
<p>l. Deposit Assistance</p>
<p>i. The Company will provide one holding deposit per pilot per assignment to an FDA, arranged through the Company’s vendor for facilitating relocations in the FDA. The holding deposit shall be offset against the pilot’s deposit assistance benefit in Paragraph C.2.l.ii of this LOA, or his housing allowance in Paragraph C.2.d. of this LOA, as applicable. In the event a rental agreement is not consummated and the holding deposit, or portion thereof is forfeited, the Company may seek reimbursement from the pilot, unless the deposit was forfeited due to circumstances beyond the pilot’s control. If a holding deposit is forfeited for reasons beyond a pilot’s control, another holding deposit may be provided at the Company’s discretion.</p>
<p>ii.  If a landlord/lessor requires an advance deposit(s) as a requirement of leasing a permanent, primary residence in the FDA, the Company shall provide deposit assistance up to a maximum of $10,000 per pilot. The purpose of the deposit assistance is to mitigate the financial burden placed upon pilots who are required to supply advance deposits. The provision of the deposit assistance shall be on a tax free basis to the pilot.</p>
<p>iii. In the event that a pilot is transitioning from one permanent, primary residence in the FDA to another, the Company shall provide deposit assistance for the rental of the second residence. When the Company renders deposit assistance for a second property without first receiving a refund of monies deposited on the first rental, the total deposit assistance outlay shall not exceed $20,000 between the two deposits; provided, however, that deposit assistance for a second property is available only if the pilot has made reasonable and timely efforts to obtain the return of his deposit by the landlord/lessor of the first property and has fully cooperated with the Company in this regard.</p>
<p>iv. This deposit shall be paid directly to the landlord/lessor, as applicable, once the pilot supplies documentation establishing the existence of the deposit requirement.</p>
<p>v. At the conclusion of the pilot’s lease, the refundable portion of the deposit for which the assistance was provided shall be returned to the Company within 60 days after the pilot receives the funds.</p>
<p>vi. The pilot/lessee shall manage his rental property in such a way as to minimize the amount, if any, withheld by the landlord/lessor. Absent extraordinary circumstances (e.g., failure to pay rent, photographically documented damage beyond normal wear and tear), the Company shall not seek reimbursement from the pilot with respect to deposit funds withheld by the pilot’s landlord/lessor. Any reimbursements due from the pilot to the Company owing to reduced deposit assistance refunds shall be treated as adjustments or reimbursements as provided in <a href="#link_3E1avi" target="_blank">Section 3.E.1.a.vi.</a> of the basic Agreement. The Company shall not discipline or counsel the pilot with respect to deposit funds withheld by the pilot’s landlord/lessor.</p>
<p>m. Realtor’s Fee</p>
<p>If there is a customary, contractual realtor’s fee associated with a pilot’s rental of his permanent, primary residence, the Company shall cover the cost of up to two such fees during the pilot’s initial commitment period in the FDA. For each additional 2 years of active service as a pilot in the FDA, the Company shall cover the cost of an additional realtor’s fee; provided, however, that the Company’s vendor for providing local real estate and orientation assistance reviews and approves the pilot’s lease(s).</p>
<p>n. Early Relocations Limitations</p>
<p>i. A pilot may elect to relocate to the FDA up to 60 days before his activation date.</p>
<p>ii. If the pilot elects to relocate prior to his activation date, upon his relocation, he shall be entitled to benefits associated with visas and other required credentials, seed money, storage, tax equalization, airline tickets, household goods shipment, orientation and housing search services, deposit assistance, and the realtor’s fee assistance.</p>
<p>iii. Requests to access the relocation benefits listed in Paragraph C.2.n.ii. of this LOA more than 60 days before a pilot’s activation date shall be at the Company’s discretion. If such a request is granted, it shall be on a non-precedential basis.</p>
<p>iv.<a href="#link_6A8" target="_blank">Section 6.A.8.</a> of the basic Agreement shall apply to pilots who relocate prior to activation.</p>
<p>v.   A pilot may be required to sign a confirmation letter acknowledging his early relocation benefits and responsibilities.</p>
<p>o. Habitation Tax</p>
<p>If a pilot’s permanent, primary residence is within the acceptable radius of his base, as provided in Paragraph C.2.d.iii. of this LOA, and he incurs a Habitation Tax during his assignment to the EMEA FDA, such tax shall be covered by the Company on a tax free basis to the pilot.</p>
<p>p. Relocation Upon Termination of Employment</p>
<p>An FDA pilot whose employment with the Company is terminated due to retirement, voluntary resignation, or disciplinary discharge (for misconduct other than that described in <a href="#link_6E2biv" target="_blank">Section 6.E.2.b.iv.</a> of the basic Agreement) shall be eligible for the same return relocation benefits that he would be eligible for if he was relocating from the FDA as a result of an award to a new crew position.</p>
<p>If an FDA pilot’s employment with the Company is terminated due to misconduct described in <a href="#link_6E2biv" target="_blank">Section 6.E.2.b.iv.</a> of the basic Agreement, the terms and conditions of that provision shall apply, regardless of whether the pilot elected the Enhanced Option or the Existing CBA Option at the beginning of his assignment to the FDA.</p>
<p>q. Miscellaneous Expense Reimbursements</p>
<p>The Company shall reimburse an FDA pilot for the following miscellaneous expenses (receipts or other documentation required, regardless of amount), provided that such reimbursement requests are submitted within 90 days of the date the expense was incurred, in accordance with the Company’s standard procedures concerning expense reporting:</p>
<p>i.   Wire transfer fees (up to a total of $600/calendar year but not more than 3 such wire transfers, or $50, per month) (Note: reimbursement requests shall be made on a quarterly basis only);</p>
<p>ii.  Ground transportation expenses (up to a total of $600 each way per assignment to an FDA) for the pilot and the members of his immediate family who are relocating with him to the FDA, as follows:</p>
<p>(a)    from his pre-FDA domestic residence to the domestic <br/>
            departure airport;</p>
<p>(b)    from the FDA arrival airport to the initial stay hotel and/or the pilot’s permanent, primary residence in the FDA;</p>
<p>(c)    from the pilot’s permanent, primary residence in the FDA to the exit transition hotel in the FDA and/or the FDA departure airport; and</p>
<p>(d)    from the domestic arrival airport to the exit transition hotel and/or his post-FDA domestic residence.</p>
<p>In appropriate circumstances (e.g., size of pilot’s traveling party, excess luggage, distance traveled, etc.) and on a case-by-case/non-precedential basis, the Company may reimburse ground transportation expenses in excess of $600. Requests for such reimbursements shall not be unreasonably denied.</p>
<p>D. FDA Transition Procedures</p>
<p>1.   Entry Transition to an FDA Crew Position from a Non-FDA Crew Position</p>
<p>a. A pilot who, at the beginning of his assignment to the FDA, elects to relocate his permanent, primary residence to the FDA rather than commute shall be subject to the following:</p>
<p>i.   Upon activation in an FDA crew position, the Company shall create a 21 consecutive day “relocation footprint” during which no flight activities will be assigned.</p>
<p>ii.  During his relocation footprint, the pilot shall relocate his permanent, primary residence to the FDA and shall complete the required immigration, visa, work/residence permit paperwork necessary for the pilot to live and work in the FDA.</p>
<p>iii. The pilot shall be positioned in the FDA, with all immigration, visa, and work/residence permit paperwork complete, and available for flight assignments no later than the 22nd day after the pilot’s activation in the FDA crew position.</p>
<p>iv.  The pilot may elect not to utilize the entire relocation footprint in the event that he has obtained all the necessary work/residence permits prior to the end of his relocation footprint.</p>
<p>b. A pilot who elects to commute to the FDA rather than relocate his permanent, primary residence to the FDA shall request and coordinate with his Fleet Captain any schedule adjustments that involve dropping activities without pay to facilitate his transition to the FDA.</p>
<p>c. Every new FDA pilot may be required to operate theatre familiarization flights, which shall be scheduled to occur as soon as operationally feasible after his arrival in the FDA (subject to the relocation footprint above).</p>
<p>2.   Exit Transition from an FDA Crew Position to a Non-FDA Crew Position</p>
<p>a. Beginning no earlier than 120 days prior to an EMEA FDA pilot’s anticipated departure date and upon written request by the pilot, the Company shall provide local assistance on the following: sending lease cancellation notice, accompanied property walk-through, documentation of property condition, negotiation of any “dilapidations,” recovery of security deposit, mail forwarding, bank account closings, utilities closings, local residency registration (notice of departure).</p>
<p>Such assistance is not currently necessary in Hong Kong. In the event the parties agree that such assistance has become necessary in Hong Kong, the parties agree to revisit this issue.</p>
<p>b. Hotel Use During Exit Transition</p>
<p>Following the earlier of the date the pilot vacates his permanent, primary residence in the FDA or the end of his housing allowance, as provided in Paragraph C.2.d.vi., and prior to his activation in his next crew position, an exiting FDA pilot may elect to stay in a hotel for up to 15 nights in either:</p>
<p>i.   a location within 100 nm of the FDA base airport;</p>
<p>ii.  the location of the pilot’s pre- or post-FDA domestic residence; and/or</p>
<p>iii. the pilot’s new base, if he is relocating his permanent, primary residence to his new base.</p>
<p>The Company shall reimburse the pilot up to the contract hotel rate for such location, but in no event shall the Company reimburse the pilot more than $250/night. An exiting FDA pilot may receive the “full” or 30 day pro-rated housing allowance (as provided in Paragraph C.2.d.vi. of this LOA) and reimbursement of hotel expenses under this paragraph at the same time. An exiting FDA pilot may also receive the “transition allowance” as provided in Paragraph D.2.c. of this LOA and reimbursement of hotel expenses under this paragraph at the same time.</p>
<p>c. Early Exit Option</p>
<p> Prior to an FDA pilot’s ITU training start date or his base transfer date, the pilot may elect to exercise an “Early Exit” option as follows:</p>
<p>i.   At a time jointly selected by the pilot and his Fleet Captain, the Company shall designate a 7 consecutive day “transition footprint” during which no flight activities will be assigned. To the extent that conflicts with the transition footprint exist, activities removed shall be pay protected. A pilot awarded a secondary line shall have 42 CH credited towards the pilot’s BLG. The pilot’s transition from the FDA must take place during the remaining bid periods prior to his ITU training start date or his base transfer date. The pilot shall use this transition footprint to relocate his permanent, primary residence from the FDA.</p>
<p>ii.  The Company shall provide the pilot with 2 monthly “transition allowance” payments, which payments shall be equal to one-half (½) of the pilot’s FDA’s monthly housing allowance (i.e., a total of 1 month of the pilot’s FDA’s monthly housing allowance). A pilot may not receive the transition allowance and the housing allowance (full or pro-rated) in the same month, nor may the pilot receive the transition allowance after the month in which he activates in his new crew position.</p>
<p>iii. If the pilot withdraws from ITU training for his new crew position and returns to his FDA crew position, he shall reimburse the transition allowance.</p>
<p>iv.  The Company shall assume responsibility for lease termination fees (up to 2 months of rental/lease payments, but not more than 2 months of housing allowance payments) incurred by the pilot as a result of his transition from the FDA; provided, however, that the pilot has taken reasonable steps to minimize such early lease termination fees (e.g., bidding for an ITU training date/slot or base transfer date so as to minimize lease termination fees, etc.).</p>
<p>d. An FDA pilot transitioning to a non-FDA crew position who does not elect the “Early Exit Option” shall be entitled to “relocation days off” following his activation date in his new crew position in accordance with the provisions of <a href="#link_6F" target="_blank">Section 6.F.</a> of the basic Agreement.</p>
<p>3.   Transition Between FDA Crew Positions</p>
<p>A pilot who is transitioning between FDA crew positions in different geographic locations shall be subject to all the provisions in Paragraph D.1. and D.2. of this LOA, except for Paragraph D.2.d. A pilot who is transitioning between FDA crew positions in the same FDA (e.g., an upgrade from 30FH to 30CH) shall not be subject to any of the provisions of Paragraph D. of this LOA. A pilot who is transitioning between crew positions in different FDAs but in the same geographic location shall be subject to the provisions of Paragraph O. of this LOA.</p>
<p>E. Tax Equalization Services</p>
<p>1.   An FDA pilot who relocates his permanent, primary residence to the FDA and receives the FDA housing allowance is required to use the tax equalization procedures and tax return filing services (US Federal, State, and foreign) offered by the Company through its tax equalization vendor.</p>
<p>a. The purpose of tax equalization is to ensure that a pilot bears approximately the same US tax burden as he would pay if he were assigned to a domestic base rather than the FDA.</p>
<p>b. To facilitate accurate tax computations and reporting, pilots will be required to provide all necessary tax information to the appointed tax provider. A pilot’s persistent failure to maintain timely contact and completion of required documentation pertaining to the tax equalization program may result in suspension of the pilot’s FDA housing allowance pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph C.2.d.v. of this LOA.</p>
<p>2.   A pilot eligible for tax equalization services shall be entitled to any accrued tax benefits based on the enrollment of dependent children in private schools located in the country in which the FDA is centered (e.g., German tax deduction for children enrolled in private schools). Any taxes based on personal or religious choices (e.g., church tax, pet tax) are not covered by the tax equalization program and are the responsibility of the pilot.</p>
<p>3.   If a pilot is not entitled to tax equalization services and his situation results in a foreign tax filing obligation in the country where the FDA airport is located, the Company shall provide foreign tax filing services through its tax equalization vendor.</p>
<p>4.   In order to facilitate tax compliance in the country where the pilot’s permanent, primary residence is located, and consistent with <a href="#link_26N2" target="_blank">Section 26.N.2.</a> of the basic Agreement, FDA pilots shall update their permanent, primary residence address in the applicable Company computer system as necessary.</p>
<p>F. FDA Re-Mail Program</p>
<p>1.   On a weekly basis, the Company shall forward a pilot’s first class mail received at the Company’s Memphis hub to the pilot’s permanent, primary residence in the country containing the airport in which the FDA base is centered.</p>
<p>2.   A HKG FDA pilot residing in the HKG Special Administrative Region (“HKG SAR”) may elect to receive such mail at the designated HKG FedEx facility (currently located at 63 Mody Road, Tsim Sha Tsui East, Hong Kong) instead of his permanent, primary residence in the HKG SAR. A HKG FDA pilot who does not reside in the HKG SAR will receive such mail at the Company’s Guangzhou, China (CAN) hub.</p>
<p>3.   For purposes of this provision, “first class mail” shall include, but not be limited to, personal correspondence mail and cards, credit card statements, bills, tax returns and notifications, mail order prescriptions, and documents issued by state and/or federal governments, that could otherwise be sent directly to the pilot at his permanent, primary residence address in the FDA pursuant to local governmental regulations.</p>
<p>4. In the event the Company provided health plan allows mail order prescriptions to be delivered directly to the pilot’s permanent, primary residence in the FDA, mail order prescriptions shall not be forwarded to the pilot pursuant to the re-mail program.</p>
<p>5.   To the extent practicable, pilots assigned to FDAs must minimize the need for first class mail to be forwarded to them pursuant to the re-mail program by, for example, updating their address for first class mail to their permanent, primary residence address in the FDA.</p>
<p>6.   In the event that a pilot will be absent from the FDA location for an extended period of time and elects to temporarily suspend the re-mail service during his absence, upon his return, the pilot must collect his mail from the designated FedEx facility and notify the Flight Operations Administrator for the FDA of his desire to restart the re-mail service.</p>
<p>G. Education Expense Reimbursement</p>
<p>1.   The Company shall reimburse documented educational expenses for an FDA-based pilot’s child(ren) between the ages of 3 and 19, which are incurred in the location of the FDA (including but not limited to reservation fees, application fees, tuition, capital expenses, books and supplies, school provided transportation, deposits, technology fees, uniform fees and other expenses related to the child(ren)’s education), up to $15,000 per family per school year.</p>
<p>2.   Education Conflicts with ITU Training or Base Transfers</p>
<p>The following applies to a pilot, who has completed his applicable commitment period, and who desires to minimize conflicts between ITU training or base transfers and their dependents’ enrollment in school in the FDA location.</p>
<p>a. During the ITU and base transfer bidding processes, an FDA pilot shall have the ability to designate his request to defer an ITU training date or base transfer date to which the pilot would have otherwise been assigned. The pilot shall have the ability to designate a preferred exit date. For FDA pilots based in an FDA centered in a European Union (“EU”) country, the preferred exit date shall comply with the time limit in Paragraph N.1. of this LOA.</p>
<p>b. The granting of a deferral request shall not result in an SDP or Inverse SDP for any pilot. If granted, the pilot shall then be assigned to start training for his awarded/assigned crew position within 60 days of his preferred exit date. The pilot shall be given at least 60 days’ notice of his assigned ITU training start date or his base transfer activation date (as applicable).</p>
<p>c. If the FDA pilot’s request is denied and the pilot is assigned to a ITU training date or base transfer date that conflicts with the pilot’s dependent’s enrollment in school in the FDA location, the Company shall reimburse the pilot for any educational expenses that the pilot is responsible for beyond the pilot’s activation date; provided however, that the pilot has taken reasonable steps to mitigate the need for the Company to reimburse the educational expenses.</p>
<p>d. This paragraph shall not apply to an FDA pilot transitioning between crew positions in the same FDA or an FDA pilot subject to Paragraphs N., O., and P. of this LOA.</p>
<p>H. Special Temporary Vacancies for FDAs</p>
<p>The following rules shall apply to Special Temporary Vacancies (STVs) in the FDA. STVs shall only be available for the first two years after each FDA opens. Thereafter, if the Company advises the Association in writing of its intent to close the FDA, the STV rules contained in this paragraph shall once again become available in the FDA that is closing, when the Company is regularly operating fewer than 50% of the aircraft which it regularly operated in that base at the time of the notification of its intent to close. The use of STVs in conjunction with a base closure is limited to 540 days from the Company’s first use of the STV application rule in that context.</p>
<p>1.   STV awards shall have a duration between one and three bid periods.</p>
<p>2.   STV awards shall begin and end concurrent with a bid period.</p>
<p>3.   A STV posting shall specify the crew position(s) from which bids will be accepted and, if applicable, the number of bids which will be awarded at each domicile from which bids are accepted.</p>
<p>4.   A pilot shall be entitled to one business class ticket positioning him to the STV location at the beginning of his assignment and back to his permanent base at the conclusion of his assignment. The Company shall also provide a pilot’s dependents with one round-trip coach class ticket from the pilot’s permanent, primary residence to the FDA location during the assignment.</p>
<p>5.   The pilot shall be entitled to per diem for the duration of his STV assignment, when the pilot is not otherwise being paid per diem (e.g., on a trip). This shall be accomplished by the submission of a pay log unless pay automation eliminates the necessity for a pay log.</p>
<p>6.   The pilot shall be entitled to Company paid lodging in accommodations of quality similar to that of the local contract hotels.</p>
<p>I. Pilots Relocating from SFS to the EMEA or HKG FDAs</p>
<p>Provided he otherwise qualifies, a pilot formerly assigned to the SFS FDA may elect to take his FDA move back provided in <a href="#link_6E2b" target="_blank">Section 6.E.2.b.</a> of the basic Agreement, prior to his activation into the FDA. Once moved back to the United States, a pilot who selects the “Enhanced Option” may take advantage of the household goods storage provided in Paragraph C.2.c. of this LOA.</p>
<p>J. Pilots Relocating from ANC to the EMEA or HKG FDAs</p>
<p>For an ANC pilot who is entitled to a “return move” relocation package from ANC, the pilots may elect to be treated in the same fashion (except that their base is in ANC and not SFS) as the SFS pilots in Paragraph I. of this LOA.</p>
<p>K. Deadhead by Surface Transportation in the EMEA and HKG FDAs</p>
<p>1.   Trains</p>
<p>a. Pilots may be scheduled to deadhead on trains in FDAs to the same extent as airplanes or ground transportation provided that, measured from scheduled departure time to scheduled arrival, trains may only be used on a scheduled basis for deadheads of less than 4<a id="_idTextAnchor622"></a> <a id="_idTextAnchor623"></a>hours,<a id="_idTextAnchor624"></a> with the following limitations:</p>
<p>i. Train travel shall only be scheduled between the following city pairs:</p>
<p>(a) CGN-FRA;</p>
<p>(b) CGN-CDG;</p>
<p>(c) CDG-FRA; and</p>
<p>(d)    CAN-HKG.</p>
<p>ii.  Trains must have a minimum two class configuration, and the Company shall book the highest class of service that is readily accessible to the public (unless otherwise authorized by the SIG).</p>
<p>iii. Train travel shall not be scheduled to occur between the hours of 0200-0459 LBT.</p>
<p>b. Trains may be used in FDAs pursuant to <a href="#link_8A3c" target="_blank">Section 8.A.3.c.</a> of the basic Agreement to the same extent as other modes of transportation mentioned therein, not to exceed 7 hours measured from scheduled departure time to scheduled arrival. Such train travel shall be booked in the highest class of service that is readily accessible to the public. If the train lacks the minimum two class configuration or a higher class is not available, train travel may be used only less than 4 hours, measured from scheduled departure time to scheduled arrival, unless waived by the pilot.</p>
<p>c. Train deadheads shall create a deviation bank in the same manner as airline tickets. In no event shall the deviation bank credit for such train deadheads be less than $150 per deadhead.</p>
<p>d. Train deadheads shall include a one-hour showtime prior to scheduled departure, which shall not count toward the h<a id="_idTextAnchor642"></a>our limit set forth in Paragraph K.1.a. and b. of this LOA.</p>
<p>e. A pilot scheduled to deadhead by train shall receive pay and credit as if t<a id="_idTextAnchor644"></a>he pilot had traveled by air.</p>
<p>f. If any FDA trip includes scheduled train travel, a pilot who operates the trip on a scheduled basis shall be able to expense up to $40.00 for each occurrence for surface transportation costs in order to position to and/or from the train station (i.e., at the beginning and/or end of a scheduled trip).</p>
<p>2.   Deadhead by Surface Transportation Other Than Train</p>
<p>a. With respect to ground transportation between <a id="_idTextAnchor647"></a>HKG-CAN and CGN-FRA, <a href="#link_8B1b" target="_blank">Section 8.B.1.b.</a> of t<a id="_idTextAnchor648"></a>he basic Agreement is waived.</p>
<p>b. With respect to ground transportation in the HKG bid period package(s) between HKG-CAN, the following additional limitations apply:</p>
<p>i.   Pick-ups for scheduled ground transportation deadheads must be prior to 2000 LBT.</p>
<p>ii.  There will be no ground transportation scheduled in the bid period package that occurs between the hours of 2331 to 0459 LBT.</p>
<p>c. With respect to ground transportation between HKG-CAN, deadheads by surface transportation other than a train shall create a deviation bank in the same manner as airline tickets. In no event shall the deviation bank credit for such surface transportation deadheads be less than $200 per deadhead.</p>
<p>L.  Reimbursement of Ground Transportation Expenses in Lieu of Airport Parking (EMEA FDA Only)</p>
<p>A pilot activated in an EMEA FDA crew position shall have the ability to expense up to $40/trip for ground transportation expenses (e.g., public train/subway/bus/taxi) to/from CGN in lieu of airport parking in accordance with <a href="#link_5F" target="_blank">Section 5.F.</a> of the basic Agreement. Reimbursement shall be limited to the pilot’s actual cost (receipt(s) required) of ground transportation to/from the FDA base airport in conjunction with a trip.</p>
<p>M. Scheduling Provisions for the EMEA and HKG FDAs</p>
<p>1.   Reserve pilots shall have a report status of R-3 for the HKG FDA or future CDG FDA, and R-2 for the CGN FDA.</p>
<p>2.   There shall be no co-terminals associated with the HKG or CGN FDAs.</p>
<p>3.   In accordance with <a href="#link_25A2" target="_blank">Section 25.A.2.</a> of the basic Agreement, the CGN FDA local base day shall begin at 0215 LBT.</p>
<p>4.   Training conducted outside of 100 nm of the HKG Special Administrative Region (“HKG SAR”) shall be considered and treated as off-site training in accordance with <a href="#link_11E1g" target="_blank">Section 11.E.1.g.</a> of the basic Agreement. If a pilot is assigned to a training event in Zhuhai, China, the pilot may expense the reasonable and customary cost of transportation between HKG and the training location in Zhuhai, as well as hotel accommodations at the contract hotel in Zhuhai. The number of nights shall be at least equal to the number of day(s) of training.</p>
<p>5.   FDA trips shall begin and end at the airport upon which the FDA is centered (i.e., the FDA base airport).</p>
<p>6.   The Company shall not schedule, in the HKG FDA bid period package(s), surface transportation deadheads between HKG-CAN that precede flight deck duty in the same duty period unless:</p>
<p>a. a day room is provided between the deadhead portion of the duty period and the flight deck duty portion of the duty period; or</p>
<p>b. the revenue departure is scheduled to occur between 1000 and 2000 LBT.</p>
<p>7.   No more than 50% of trips in the HKG bid period package shall have front-end surface transportation deadheads to CAN (unless otherwise authorized by the SIG).</p>
<p>N. Maximum Duration of Assignment to an FDA i<a id="_idTextAnchor660"></a>n a European Union Country and Subsequent Bidding Limitations</p>
<p>1.   The maximum duration of assignment to an FDA centered in a European Union (“EU”) country shall be 4 years, 11 months as measured from the earlier of the pilot’s activation date in his FDA crew position or his registration with local immigration authorities.</p>
<p>2.   A pilot who has been stationed in an FDA centered in an EU country for 4 years shall have the ability to be awarded a crew position in another geographic location without a System Bid as follows:</p>
<p>a. The pilot shall notify his Fleet Captain (or his designee) in writing of the election under this paragraph at least 90 days prior to the pilot’s 48th month in his FDA crew position, as measured from the earlier of the pilot’s activation date in his FDA crew position or his registration with local immigration authorities. The pilot’s notice shall include:</p>
<p>i.   The selection by the pilot of a crew position in a different geographic location in which he would not be the junior awarded/assigned pilot in that crew position.</p>
<p>ii.  The pilot’s preferred exit date (i.e., the date upon which the pilot desires to start ITU training for or base transfer to his selected crew position), which shall be no earlier than 4 years and no later than 4 years and 11 months following the earlier of the pilot’s activation date in his FDA crew position or his registration with local immigration authorities. The Company shall assign the pilot to an ITU training start date or a base transfer activation date (subject to the applicable contractual provisions concerning the timing of base transfers, e.g., <a href="#link_25C6" target="_blank">Section 25.C.6.</a>), which shall not be less than 90 days from the date of the pilot’s election.</p>
<p>iii. The Company shall provide the pilot with a minimum of 60 days’ notice of his assigned ITU training start or base transfer activation date, which date shall be no earlier than the pilot’s preferred exit date and no later than 21 days after the pilot’s preferred exit date.</p>
<p>b. If the pilot does not make this election, the Company shall assign the pilot to a crew position in a different geographic location in which he would not be the junior awarded/assigned pilot in that crew position. This shall occur at 4 years and 3 months following the earlier of the pilot’s activation date in his FDA crew position or his registration with local immigration authorities. A pilot assigned to another crew position pursuant to this subparagraph may be assigned an ITU training start date or a base transfer activation date (subject to the applicable contractual provisions concerning the timing of base transfers, e.g., <a href="#link_25C6" target="_blank">Section 25.C.6.</a>) consistent with Company staffing requirements. The Company shall provide the pilot with a minimum of 60 days’ notice prior to the ITU training start date or base transfer activation date<a id="_idTextAnchor665"></a>.</p>
<p>c. The exercise of this paragraph shall not be considered an assignment pursuant to <a href="#link_24C2" target="_blank">Section 24.C.2.</a> A pilot assigned to an ITU training date/slot pursuant to this paragraph shall not generate an SDP or an inverse SDP for any pilot.</p>
<p>3.   After a pilot leaves an FDA centered in an EU country, he may not be activated in that crew base for at least one year after the last day of his previous assignment, provided that he activates in another crew position based outside of the country in which the FDA is centered and he establishes a permanent, primary residence outside of the country in which the FDA is centered. This limitation shall not apply if the subsequent crew base at which the pilot is stationed is centered in a country in which the pilot has never been based as a FedEx Express employee.</p>
<p>4. If the Company establishes a new FDA in an EU country that requires a maximum duration different than the limit specified above, the Company shall publish that limit as provided in Paragraph B.1. of this LOA. All other provisions of this paragraph shall apply to such FDA.</p>
<p>O. Crew Position Changes to Different FDAs in the Same Geographic Location</p>
<p>If the Company opens multiple FDAs in the same geographic location (e.g., MD-11 HKG; A300 HKG), the following shall apply to pilots who activate into a different FDA within the same geographic location (e.g., an MD-11 F/O HKG upgrades to an A300 CA HKG).</p>
<p>1. The following shall apply to pilots who chose the Enhanced Option as part of their original award:</p>
<p>a. Such pilots shall be eligible for the benefits described in Paragraph C.2.a. (Seed Money) and C.2.b. (Four Year Service Credit) of this LOA, treating their new award as a completely separate award to an FDA in the EMEA or HKG.</p>
<p>b. A pilot’s activation into a different FDA in the same geographic location as his current FDA award restarts that pilot’s service commitment under Paragraph C. of this LOA (i.e., the pilot’s service in his prior FDA does not “count” toward his service commitment in the new FDA).</p>
<p>c. The benefits described in Paragraph C.2.c. (Storage), C.2.d. (Housing Allowance), C.2.e. (Tax Equalization), C.2.f. (Airline Tickets), and C.2.h. (Household Goods Shipments) of this LOA shall be administered as if the pilot had not changed FDAs, but rather had been on one continuous assignment in the same FDA.</p>
<p>d. If a pilot’s crew position changes to a different FDA in the same geographic location and the pilot has not completed his original commitment period, the pilot shall not be eligible to receive the seed money otherwise provided by Paragraph O.1.a. of this LOA.</p>
<p>2. Pilots who chose the Existing CBA Option as part of their original award shall continue to receive tax equalization benefits provided by Paragraph E. of this LOA.</p>
<p>P. FDA Exit in Lieu of Normal System Bid Award</p>
<p>A pilot activated in a crew position in an FDA without a maximum service limit as described in Paragraph N. of this LOA shall have the ability to select a new non-FDA crew position award without a System Bid award/assignment as follows:</p>
<p>1. The pilot shall notify his Fleet Captain (or his designee) in writing of the election under this paragraph, which shall include:</p>
<p>a. The selection by the pilot of a non-FDA crew position in which he would not be the junior awarded/assigned pilot in that crew position; and</p>
<p>b. The pilot’s preferred exit date (i.e., the date upon which the pilot desires to start ITU training for or base transfer to his desired crew position), which shall not be less than 6 months from the date of the notice. The preferred exit date must be after the completion of the pilot’s commitment period, plus 12 months.</p>
<p>2. The Company shall notify the pilot if it requires a replacement pilot and shall conduct a System Bid within 30 days of the pilot’s notice in accordance with Section 24 of the basic Agreement.</p>
<p>3.   In the event the FDA vacancy is filled or a replacement pilot was not required, the Company shall provide the pilot with a minimum of 60 days’ notice of his assigned ITU training start or base transfer activation date, and such date must be within 75 days of the pilot’s preferred exit date.</p>
<p>4.   In the event that the posted vacancy is not filled, the Company may conduct another System Bid within 30 days of the closing of first System Bid.</p>
<p>a. If the vacancy is filled or if the Company elects not to conduct a second System Bid, the Company shall provide the pilot with a minimum of 60 days’ notice of his assigned ITU training or base transfer date, and such date must be within 75 days of the pilot’s preferred exit date.</p>
<p>b. If the Company conducts a second System Bid and the vacancy is not filled for a second time, the Company shall provide the pilot with a minimum of 60 days’ notice of his assigned ITU training or base transfer date, and such date must be no later than 180 days beyond the preferred exit date.</p>
<p>5. Pilots employing this paragraph shall be restricted from participating in System Bids until the pilot is transferred to his selected crew position or begins ITU training for his selected crew position, unless waived by the Vice President of Flight Operations.</p>
<p>6. The exercise of this paragraph shall not be considered an assignment pursuant to <a href="#link_24C2" target="_blank">Section 24.C.2.</a> A pilot assigned to an ITU training date/slot pursuant to this paragraph shall not generate an SDP or an inverse SDP for any pilot.</p>
<p>Q. Unexpected Unavailability In FDA</p>
<p>1. If an FDA pilot becomes unavailable for line flying (e.g., due to long-term sick leave, loss of medical, LTD, leave of absence, etc.) and the absence is expected to last longer than one year, the affected pilot may request that he and his dependents be returned from his FDA to his pre-FDA residence without penalty, pursuant to Paragraph C.2.f.i.(b). (Airline Tickets) and Paragraph C.2.h.ii. (Return Household Goods Shipment), Paragraph C.2.q.ii. (Reimbursement for Ground Transportation Expenses), and Paragraph D.2.a. and b. (Exit Transition Procedures). Such requests shall not be unreasonably denied.</p>
<p>If the pilot does not make such a request, he shall be eligible to continue receiving the FDA housing allowance, provided that he maintains his permanent, primary residence in the FDA during the period of his unavailability.</p>
<p>2.   If no request is made by the pilot after one year or more of absence, his circumstances shall be reviewed to determine if he is expected to be available to return to active flying within two years from the date of his first absence. In the event the decision is that the pilot will not be able to return to active flying during the 2 year period, the pilot will be given the option to either return to his pre-FDA residence without penalty or lose his FDA housing allowance for the period of his continued unavailability.</p>
<p>3.   Regardless of which of these options the pilot elects, he may also request to be released from his FDA crew position and assigned (as that term is defined in Section 24) to another crew position in accordance with Paragraph B.4.d. of this LOA. Such requests shall not be unreasonably denied and shall be granted on a non-precedential basis.</p>
<p>4.   In no event, however, shall the Company be obligated to provide more than a cumulative total of 26 months of housing allowance continuation pursuant to Paragraph Q. (this paragraph) during an assignment to an FDA.</p>
<p>5.   If the pilot’s unavailability for line flying is the result of a medical condition, the Company may direct the pilot to be evaluated by the Company’s aeromedical advisor, in accordance with <a href="#link_15D" target="_blank">Section 15.D.</a>, but only to determine the expected duration of the pilot’s unavailability. Referrals to the Company’s aeromedical advisor pursuant to this paragraph shall not be considered a violation of <a href="#link_15D1" target="_blank">Section 15.D.1.</a> of the basic Agreement.</p>
<p>R. Line of Credit Facilitation</p>
<p>The Company shall negotiate with a reputable local bank in the city in which the FDA is centered in an attempt to reduce or eliminate any minimum deposit requirements such bank may require to open a local bank account. The purpose of this provision is to attempt to provide at least one bank in each FDA where minimum deposits, beyond those customarily found in U.S. banks, are either not required, or at least minimized.</p>
<p>S. Timing of Recurrent Training Pay/Adjustments For FDA Assigned Pilots</p>
<p>If an FDA pilot’s recurrent training award creates a phase-in conflict under the terms of the basic Agreement, the pay deduction for the trip(s) and/or R-day(s) dropped shall be delayed by one month from the standard schedule for phase-in conflict deductions.</p>
<p>T.   Recurrent and ITU Training Deviation Travel</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the provisions of <a href="#link_8C2a" target="_blank">Sections 8.C.2.a.</a> and <a href="#link_8C4e" target="_blank">8.C.4.e.</a> of the basic Agreement to the contrary:</p>
<p>1.    For a pilot activated in a HKG or EMEA FDA crew position, the pilot shall have a separate deviation bank established for the value of any scheduled deadhead travel to recurrent or ITU training in Memphis or another location within the contiguous 48 states, should such location be used for recurrent or ITU training.</p>
<p>2.   The pilot may expand the current 3 day window in <a href="#link_8C4e" target="_blank">Section 8.C.4.e.</a> in the manner below, during which the pilot may use the recurrent or ITU training deviation bank (“expanded window”).</p>
<p>a. The expanded window shall begin at the end of the last scheduled activity prior to training and end at the beginning of the first scheduled activity following training.</p>
<p>b. A “scheduled activity” ends at the conclusion of the last duty period for a trip, the conclusion or release from a standby period, or upon release from, or at the conclusion of, a reserve period.</p>
<p>c. A “scheduled activity” starts at the showtime of the first duty period for a trip, the showtime for an airport standby period, or the beginning of the notification window for a reserve period.</p>
<p>d. For the purposes of this paragraph, a substitution window is a “scheduled activity.”</p>
<p>3.   A pilot may create an expanded window through any, or all, of the following means:</p>
<p>a. Monthly bid awards for the recurrent or ITU training month, as well as those months prior to and following recurrent or ITU training;</p>
<p>b. Provisions of <a href="#link_25L" target="_blank">Section 25.L.</a> (e.g., dropping a trip(s) or R-day(s), or trading with open time or another pilot); and/or</p>
<p>c. The use of scheduled vacation, including permissible vacation adjustments (e.g., exchange, trade, slide, expansion, or extension).</p>
<p>4.   During the expanded window, the delay en-route limits identified in <a href="#link_8C4e" target="_blank">Section 8.C.4.e.</a> are waived, except as provided below.</p>
<p>5.   Two series of flights for each deviation from a scheduled front- or back-end deadhead shall be allowable/reimbursable air travel deviation expenses from the separate recurrent or ITU training deviation bank.</p>
<p>a. A series of flights is continuous air travel that is not interrupted by a layover of more than 24 hours, and may begin or end with jumpseat travel on Company aircraft.</p>
<p>b. Front-end Deviation(s)</p>
<p>i.   The first series of flights must begin at an airport in the FDA theatre of operations that is served by Company trunk aircraft or at a commercial passenger airport within 100 nm of the FDA base airport and end at a location in:</p>
<p>(a)    The contiguous 48 United States; or</p>
<p>(b)    Another location if pre-approved, in writing (e-mail is sufficient), by the pilot’s Fleet Captain (or his designee).</p>
<p>ii.  The second series of flights must begin at one of the locations described by Paragraph T.5.b.i.(a) or (b) of this LOA, and end at the location of the pilot’s recurrent or ITU training. The second series of flights is not required to begin at the same location in which the first series of flights ended.</p>
<p>c. Back-end Deviation(s)</p>
<p>i.   The first series of flights must begin at the location of the pilot’s recurrent or ITU training and end at a location described by Paragraph T.5.b.i.(a) or (b) of this LOA.</p>
<p>ii.  The second series of flights must begin at a location described by Paragraph T.5.b.i.(a) or (b) of this LOA, and end at an airport in the FDA theatre of operations that is served by Company trunk aircraft or at a commercial passenger airport within 100 nm of the FDA base airport. The second series of flights is not required to begin at the same location in which the first series of flights ended.</p>
<p>For purposes of this Paragraph T. of this LOA only, the phrase “FDA theatre of operations” refers to the sum of the lane segments typically operated as part of the EMEA network (for the EMEA FDA) or the APAC network (for the HKG FDA). The phrase “FDA theatre of operations” does not refer to the “European theater” in Section <a href="#link_12D1cii" target="_blank">12.D.1.c.ii.</a> of the basic Agreement.</p>
<p>U.   Deferral of Obligation to “Protect” New Hire Junior Activation Compensation</p>
<p>If an FDA pilot is entitled to New Hire Junior Activation Compensation (<a href="#link_24F7" target="_blank">Section 24.F.7.</a>) and would otherwise be required to bid to a crew position in a different geographic location in order to “protect” his entitlement, the pilot may defer his obligation to protect his entitlement by electing to remain in his current FDA crew position:</p>
<p>1.   until he is required to be awarded or assigned (as those terms are defined in Section 24) to a new crew position pursuant to Paragraph N. of this LOA (for EMEA FDA pilots); or</p>
<p>2.   for at least an additional 2 years beyond the pilot’s commitment period (for HKG FDA pilots), at which time his New Hire Junior Activation Compensation repayment obligations, if any, shall be determined in accordance with <a href="#link_24F8" target="_blank">Section 24.F.8.</a> of the basic Agreement.</p>
<p>V.   Local Telephone Access to Contact the Company</p>
<p>The Company agrees to provide “local” and/or “toll-free” telephone access for FDA pilots to contact the Company for business or operational purposes only (e.g., operational check-in(s) with CRS; contact Global Travel, Crew Audit, Training, Fleet Captain/Manager, Pilot Administration Center, etc.). Information concerning this telephone access and its use shall be posted on the FDA page of pilot.fedex.com.</p>
<p>W. Language Lessons</p>
<p>The Berlitz online language courses taught through the Berlitz Virtual Classroom (BVC) will continue to be eligible through the Tuition Assistance program provided the approved courses are paid for and receipts issued in US dollars (and subject to the overriding provisions of <a href="#link_26I" target="_blank">Section 26.I.</a>)</p>
<p>X. Ongoing Implementation Measures</p>
<p>The parties recognize that the details involved in opening and operating foreign pilot bases are varied and fluid. Other measures facilitating the operation of the pilot bases in the EMEA and in HKG and supporting the pilots based there may be implemented if agreed upon in writing by the Vice President, Labor Relations Law and the Association’s MEC Chairman.</p>
<p>Y. Effective Date and Duration</p>
<p>This LOA is effective on the date signed and shall remain in full force and
  effect concurrent with the basic Agreement.</p>

<h1 class="persist-header">General Implementation Appendix and Timeline</h1>
<p>2015 FedEx Pilot Collective Bargaining Agreement</p>
<p>This appendix sets out the timeline upon which each of the already-identified changes in the Tentative Agreement will be implemented following ratification. Items which are specifically referenced in the contract as having a later implementation date are not repeated in this appendix and will be implemented on the date specified in the Agreement. In the main table, all dates indicate that the particular provision will be implemented not later than the date stated. In the programming sub-appendices for work rules (Sections 4, 12, and 25), deadheading (Section 8), filling of crew positions (Section 24), and retirement and insurance (Sections 27 and 28), two dates are indicated – a target date, by which the Company intends to implement each particular change, and a delivery date, beyond which the Company would be in violation of the Agreement if it has not implemented the change. Under the Letter of Agreement entitled, “Implementation and Transition,” the parties may, by mutual agreement, alter the timelines set forth in this appendix to achieve a smooth transition into the new Agreement.</p>
