MTOGW, shall be flown only by pilots whose names appear on the Federal Express Master Seniority List in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.</p>
              <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 1.B.1." rel="tooltip">1.</span> “Domestic flights” are all those Company flights wherein all flight legs within a single pairing originate and terminate at cities located solely within the contiguous 48 states.</p>
              <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 1.B.2." rel="tooltip">2.</span> “International flights” are all Company flights which originate from, terminate in or transit the U.S. or its territories via a location outside the contiguous 48 states. International flights also include all flights conducted by any pilots on the Federal Express Master Seniority List assigned to Foreign Duty Assignment (“FDA”), or Special International Bid Award (“SIBA”).</p>
              <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 1.B.3." rel="tooltip">3.</span> All Domestic and International revenue flights conducted with aircraft that are owned, leased, or operated by the Company, having a MTOGW of greater than 60,000 lbs., and operated pursuant to the Company’s Airline Operating Certificate or any additional Part 121 Airline Operating Certificate obtained by the Company, shall be operated by pilots on the Federal Express Master Seniority List in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. Flying conducted with aircraft at or under 60,000 lbs. MTOGW (commonly referred to as “feeder flying”) shall not be substituted for Federal Express trunk flying (over 60,000 lbs. MTOGW) so as to cause a furlough of any Federal Express pilot. However, if and to the extent that and for such period of time that the furlough is the result of an act beyond the control of the Company (e.g., FAA grounding of a fleet, etc.), feeder/wet lease flying may be used to replace lost trunk flying. The Company shall not deploy multiple feeder flying in the domestic system to effect an elimination/reduction of the overall flying of an affected aircraft type; however, the Company may use multiple feeders to assume some existing trunk flying when aircraft or lift shortages exist during high volume periods. If feeder flying is substituted for Federal Express trunk flying, any pilots who are assigned a crew position as a result of such substitution (and not due to changes in fleet deployment or composition unrelated to feeder flying such as retirement/replacement of, e.g., B727 aircraft) shall not have their hourly rate of pay reduced. This hourly rate protection shall end if a junior pilot is activated into a higher paying crew position that the senior pilot could have bid upon and been awarded, but elected not to do so.</p>
              <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 1.B.4." rel="tooltip">4.</span> Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, the Company may continue to interline, co-load, code-share, part charter and enter into block space agreements with other carriers to move freight and service in International (outside the contiguous 48 states) markets as required.

    <p>A pilot with vacation during a month in which he holds a reserve line may extend the vacation that occurs in that month. Vacation buffers shall then be added to the extended vacation as provided in <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_7G3a">Section 7.G.3.a.</a>, unless waived by the pilot.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 7.G.3.e.i." rel="tooltip">i.</span> The maximum extension shall be determined by the following formula:</p>
      <p>Maximum Extension = ({[(Number of vacation days (as awarded or slid) in the bid period multiplied by 6) + 6] ÷ R-day value} rounded down) minus the number of originally scheduled vacation days in the bid period.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Example: A pilot has a 7 day vacation period in a bid period in which the R-day value is 4:36. The maximum extension is</p>
        <p>{[(7 x 6) +6] ÷ 4.600} - 7</p>
        <p>= [(42 + 6) ÷ 4.600] - 7</p>
        <p>= (10.434 rounded down) - 7</p>
        <p>= 10 - 7 = 3.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Consequently, the pilot could add up to three days to his vacation period. This would give him a total of 14 days (presuming buffers could fit on both ends of his vacation period as extended). The pilot’s vacation bank would be charged 46 CH (10 x 4.600), but only 7 vacation days would be removed from his vacation accrual.</p>

      <p>Example: A pilot’s 10 day vacation period has 7 days in one bid period and 3 days in the next. The pilot holds a reserve line in both bid periods. R-day value in the first bid period is 4:36; in the second it is 4:47. The pilot may extend his vacation a maximum of 3 days in the first bid period (which must expand backward, since he can’t expand outside of the bid period). The vacation in the second month is treated as if it were a stand alone 3 day vacation period, for purposes of expansion. His maximum expansion would be 3 x 6 = 18 + 6 = 24 ÷ 4.783 = 5.017 rounded down = 5 minus 3 = 2 days of available extension.</p>

<p><strong>H.   The Training Review Board (TRB)</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1. General Decision-Making</p>
      <p>The TRB is established to resolve situations involving individual pilots in training.</p>
      <p>The TRB shall be governed by a train to proficiency philosophy for pilots in training. Individual pilots will be dealt with on a case by case basis, without regard to past precedent. If reasonable progress is being made and there is reason to believe the pilot will ultimately be successful, training is usually extended. The overall goal of the TRB is the continuing improvement and quality assurance of the Company’s training program. The TRB shall make its decisions and recommendations based on consensus (i.e., Consensus of the Training Review Board).</p>
      <p>2. The TRB shall be notified following the failure of any validation/evaluation event or failure to achieve any required recommendations. The appropriate training manager administers remedial training in accordance with TRB prescriptions.</p>
      <p>3. The TRB shall meet to consider any of the following situations (for which there are no remedial training prescriptions):</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>a. The election of a pilot to withdraw from training on or after the first day of training;</p>
        <p>b.   A failure of TRB assigned additional training;</p>
        <p>c.   A failure to be recommended for a validation/evaluation event;</p>
        <p>d.   A second failure of an evaluation event;</p>
        <p>e.   A failure to complete recurrent downbid training (<a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11J6">Section 11.J.6.</a>);</p>
        <p>f.   At the discretion of the TRB, a failure of an evaluation event while enrolled in the Enhanced Oversight Program (EOP);</p>
        <p>g.   If a pilot is initially covered under the ASAP program, but is ultimately excluded from the program as provided in ASAP MOU paragraph 11.f., his case shall be referred to the TRB for any necessary requalification training (as provided in <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_26Y4">Section 26.Y.4.</a>); or</p>
        <p>h.   Training irregularities (e.g., ITU, recurrent) that occur during a pilot’s probationary period, provided however, that the TRB’s involvement does not limit the Company’s rights to apply <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_22B1f">Section 22.B.1.f.</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>4. Except in extenuating circumstances, the TRB shall confer within 2 business days following the occurrence of an event that requires a TRB meeting.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>a.   The TRB shall conduct activities in strict confidence. TRB meetings shall be restricted to TRB members unless all TRB members agree otherwise, on a case by case basis. If a non-TRB member(s) is permitted at a TRB meeting, such attendee(s) shall be bound by the same confidentiality requirements that are applicable to the TRB members.</p>
        <p>b.   The Company shall provide the TRB members and the pilot with copies of the pilot’s training records and any other documents pertaining to the matter no later than 2 business days prior to the TRB meeting.</p>
        <p>c.   The pilot shall have the right to make a presentation and to offer input to the TRB. The pilot may be required to appear before the TRB. Any time a pilot appears before the TRB, at the pilot’s request, an Association representative may observe the proceedings during the time of the pilot’s presence.</p>
        <p>d.   When necessary, Association TRB members shall be removed from activities to attend TRB meetings as provided in <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_18A2a">Section 18.A.2.a.</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>5. The TRB shall have broad discretion in the action to be taken by individual pilots and the Company. TRB meetings shall occur in the manner agreed upon by TRB members (e.g., in person, telephonically, electronically, etc.). Action may include, but is not limited to:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>a.   Additional training;</p>
        <p>b.   Change of instructor;</p>
        <p>c.   Change of support pilot;</p>
        <p>d.   Change of training times;</p>
        <p>e.   Change of training location;</p>
        <p>f.   Removal of pilot from ITU/recurrent training;</p>
        <p>g.   Crew position freezes;</p>
        <p>h.   Crew position reassignment consistent with the pilot’s seniority, based upon the same or a subsequent System Bid;</p>
        <p>i.   Individual plans for requalification training, which may include crew position assignment, duration of freeze, and/or training plan;</p>
        <p>j.   Referral to MEC Pilot Assistance Committee;</p>
        <p>k.   Referral to System Chief Pilot, who shall address his case as circumstances warrant;</p>
        <p>l.   Pilot counseling;</p>
        <p>m.   Enrollment in the EOP;</p>
        <p>n.   Other.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>6. In the absence of a consensus concerning TRB recommended actions, the SCP shall use his best efforts to broker a consensus among the members of the TRB. In the event consensus cannot then be reached, the SCP shall determine the resolution. In the event the SCP is not on the Master Seniority List, the Company shall designate a member who is on the Master Seniority List to perform these functions.</p>
      <p>7. If a pilot disagrees with the TRB’s decision, the pilot may appeal such to the SCP.</p>
      <p>8. If the TRB authorizes additional training and if, after additional training, the pilot is still unable to progress further in the training program or unable to pass the required tests or validations/evaluations, the pilot’s matter will be referred back to the TRB for disposition. When a case has been referred back to the TRB after an earlier decision has not produced the desired results, the TRB may direct additional actions, (including referral to the SCP).</p>
      <p>9. The deliberations and decisions of the TRB shall be non-precedential and shall not be discoverable, referenced or introduced as evidence in any grievance proceeding or arbitration involving any pilot other than the pilot to whom the TRB deliberations and decisions pertain.</p>
      <p>10.    Pilots frozen in their crew position or in any way restricted from freely exercising their seniority rights shall not be eligible for System Bid awards for the duration of such freeze. Upon written request from the pilot, the SCP shall review crew position freezes approximately at the midpoint of the freeze for reconsideration.</p>
    </blockquote>
<p><strong>I.   Enhanced Oversight Program (EOP)</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1. The EOP exists to ensure that pilots who have demonstrated notable deficiencies during training or evaluation events maintain the required Company standards after remediation has been completed.</p>
      <p>2. Pilots will normally be enrolled into the EOP following a validation/evaluation grade of unsatisfactory. The Training Review Board (TRB) may also enroll a pilot in the EOP.</p>
      <p>3. The period of the EOP enrollment will normally extend 12 months from the date successful remediation is complete. However, should a subsequent evaluation/validation failure occur during the pilot’s enrollment period, his enrollment may be extended to a date beyond the initial 12 months as determined by the TRB.</p>
      <p>4. Pilots entering the EOP will be advised via VIPS notification of their enrollment. Assuming no deficiencies are noted during a pilot’s EOP enrollment, the pilot will be released from the EOP and advised via VIPS notification.</p>
      <p>5. The 4 principal members of the TRB will comprise the Enhanced Oversight Group (EOG), and will have direct access to, and will jointly manage the EOP list. The EOG will confer on a quarterly basis to review the EOP list and to ensure its accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>J.   Withdrawals, Removals, Freezes and Reassignments</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1. A pilot may elect to withdraw from training at any time.</p>
      <p>2. If the pilot elects to withdraw from training prior to his award or assignment to a monthly training slot, the election will be reviewed by the System Chief Pilot (SCP).<a id="_idTextAnchor271"></a></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p id="link_11J2a" class="link_highlight">a.   If extenuating circumstances exist, the pilot will return to his current crew position and shall incur no crew position freeze.</p>

      <p>7. The Company shall not place a Check Airman in pay only status for more than 2 consecutive bid periods without his concurrence. However, if it is necessary to place a Check Airman (except for those qualified only as LCAs) in pay only status for more than 2 consecutive bid periods, the Company may fill those requirements in inverse seniority order.</p>
      <p id="link_11M8" class="link_highlight">8. In order to provide an opportunity for pay only Check Airmen to maintain line proficiency in their respective aircraft, the following shall apply to all Check Airmen, except those qualified only as LCAs:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>a.   During a Check Airman’s third consecutive pay only bid period, he shall be scheduled for 2 PDO fly days in lieu of scheduled training events, subject to the limitations contained in <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11M9">Section 11.M.9.</a> (PDO Bid Period). Due to the lengths of trips in certain domiciles, PDO fly days may be pooled to accommodate a trip longer than 2 days.</p>
        <p>b.   During a Check Airman’s fourth consecutive pay only bid period, he shall have eligibility equal to the CH value of 2 R-days (or a minimum of 4:30 CHs/day) available to him in the Secondary Working Window (SWW, see <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E6">Section 25.E.6.</a>) (SWW Bid Period). The Check Airman’s schedule shall include 2 fewer instructional days in an SWW Bid Period, unless deferred in accordance with <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11M10b">Section 11.M.10.b.</a></p>
        <p>c.   For each additional consecutive pay only bid period, the Check Airman’s proficiency flying eligibility shall alternate between PDO and SWW Bid Periods. When a Check Airman flexes back to line flying (i.e., is awarded a line for flying purposes) and he subsequently flexes back to his instructional duties (i.e., is awarded a line for pay only purposes), he will again be eligible for proficiency flying after his 3rd consecutive pay only bid period. However, he will resume the alternating proficiency flying pattern established when he was last eligible for proficiency flying.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Example: A Check Airman is scheduled for 4 consecutive pay only instructional bid periods (January, February, March, and April). March shall be a PDO Bid Period and April shall be a SWW Bid Period.</p>
          <p>Example: A Check Airman is scheduled for 3 consecutive pay only instructional bid periods (January, February, and March). March shall be a PDO Bid Period. In April, the Check Airman is flexed back to line flying. The Check Airman is flexed back to instructional activities in May and is scheduled for 4 consecutive pay only instructional bid periods (May, June, July, and August). July shall be a SWW Bid Period and August shall be a PDO Bid Period.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>d.   In order to maintain currency, proficiency with line operating policies and procedures, and enhance his professional capabilities, each Check Airman shall seek to attain 100 block hours (reducible by 2 hours per landing) per calendar year in the crew status in which he conducts training.</p>
        <p>e.   When a Check Airman’s schedule includes a combination of instruction/evaluation flying events, and simulator and/or ground training events (i.e., “combo line”), that schedule shall not be considered as a “pay only bid period” for the purposes of <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11M8">Section 11.M.8.</a></p>

        <p>a.   A Check Airman may bump another pilot from his assigned trip(s) in order to maintain his proficiency in the crew status in which he conducts training.</p>
        <p>b.   No pilot may be bumped without his consent.</p>
        <p>c.   Check Airmen may PDO bump a pilot in any base.</p>
        <p>d.   A Check Airman may bump a seat in which he is qualified but cannot hold based on his system seniority, but only if an LCA, SCA, or PCA (who is a Captain by seniority) occupies the other seat.</p>

        <p id="link_11M10a" class="link_highlight">a.   A Check Airman’s schedule shall include 2 fewer days, unless deferred as provided in Section 11.M.10.b. below;</p>
        <p id="link_11M10b" class="link_highlight">b.   A Check Airman may defer the schedule reduction that otherwise would occur, in accordance with Section 11.M.10.a., in order to be entitled – in a subsequent, pay only bid period – to an aggregate schedule reduction of no more than 8 days.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Example: A Check Airman is placed in pay only status for a third consecutive bid period (which, based on the pattern established in Section 11.M.8., is an SWW Bid Period), and as such is entitled to a 2-day schedule reduction. He elects to defer that reduction, so his instructional schedule is not reduced. During his next SWW Bid Period, he elects not to defer, and also elects to use the previously deferred 2-day reduction. His training schedule for that bid period will be reduced by a total of 4 days.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>c.   A Check Airman will have corresponding proficiency (PRO) flying eligibility during the SWW (see <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E6">Section 25.E.6.</a>) as follows:</p>

For each day by which a pay only Check Airman’s schedule is reduced, as provided in Section 11.M.10.a., as applicable, the CH value of an R-day (or a minimum of 4:30 CH) shall be available for participation in the Secondary Working Window (SWW) (See <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E6">Section 25.E.6.</a>), and a corresponding, temporary BLG reduction shall also occur (subject to the proficiency flying/secondary line process immediately below);</p>
          <p>ii.    The eligibility will also include the CHs previously deferred as provided in Section 11.M.10.b. above, but in no case shall the eligibility exceed 36 CH (at which time the pilot must exercise his PRO flying eligibility);</p>
          <p>iii.   During the SWW, this eligibility may be used to preference trips from open time, which will be assigned using the PRO assignment code. The pilot may not voluntarily use, toward his secondary line construction, standby trips, R-day blocks, or Relief Flight Officer (RFO/RF2) trips. The PRO assignment code will have the same pay characteristics as TRP;</p>
          <p>iv.    PRO eligibility shall be exercised at the pilot’s relative seniority;</p>
          <p>v. PRO eligibility may be exceeded by as much as 9 CH for each bid period in which such eligibility is exercised; and</p>
          <p>vi.    When a Check Airman is assigned to an R-day(s), through this process, he shall either:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>(a)  notify his Training or Standards Manager, no later than the last Friday prior to the start of the bid period in which such R-day(s) occur, to have such R-day(s) be dropped without pay and eligible for make-up; or</p>
            <p>(b)  have zero leveling on the first such R-day, and shall be in First Fly status for each such R-day.</p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p>d.   In no event shall a pilot begin a pay only SWW bid period below the applicable Minimum Bid Period Guarantee, subject to the provisions of <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4A">Section 4.A.</a></p>

      <p>11.    A Check Airman shall be notified of his pay only status at least 48 hours prior to the opening of the monthly bid, unless waived. The following shall apply for a Check Airman when he is bidding in a pay only status in order to perform Check Airman duties.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>a. The maximum number of scheduled duty days shall not exceed the maximum number of R-days in the bid perio<a id="_idTextAnchor320"></a>d.</p>
        <p>b.   Pay only carryover CHs shall be deposited into the Check Airman’s General Make-up Bank (GMB).</p>
        <p>c.   A Check Airman bidding in pay only status may designate days free from duty as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>i. Up to 5 days off, which may not be in more than 2 blocks, in a 4-week bid period; or</p>

          <p>He may provide primary and secondary requests for the specific days off, and the Company shall accommodate 1 of those requests. If 2 or more Check Airmen request the same days off, those requests shall be considered in seniority order.</p>

        <p>d. A Check Airman bidding in pay only status shall be notified of his pay only schedule as soon as practicable, but no later than 72 hours prior to the beginning of the bid period.</p>
        <p>e.   If he so desires, a Check Airman may pick up an instruction/evaluation activity by using credits in his General Make-Up Bank (GMB). Such activity does not constitute an excess of <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11M6a">Section 11.M.6.a.</a> (maximum number of scheduled duty days).

      <p>25.    Unless waived by mutual consent (Check Airman and appropriate Standards or Training Manager), a Check Airman shall maintain his originally scheduled simulator period over consecutive days. The Company may revise the period to either the immediate earlier period or immediate subsequent period, once during the consecutive days. Any further revision during the consecutive days is limited to a return to the originally scheduled simulator period. This paragraph shall not apply to extra training (ET) administered following a training failure, or to training administered following an “incomplete” event.</p>
      <p>26.    If a Check Airman who is in TDNIF status is not current, he shall be permitted to provide simulator/ground instruction.</p>
      <p>27.    Bid periods in which a Check Airman is scheduled for an awarded vacation shall be non-instructional bid periods to the greatest extent practical. A Check Airman, however, who is utilized for training during a month in which he has vacation shall have his bid period schedule reduced, day for day, by the number of days in his vacation period. His vacation bank shall be reduced by an R-day value for each day of vacation. A Check Airman:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>a.   May adjust his vacation period by sliding it up to a maximum of 5 days in either direction, in accordance with Section 7; and</p>

        <p>c.   An Instructor Pilot shall be notified of his pay only status at least 48 hours prior to the opening of the monthly bid, except by mutual consent.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>6. In the event that an Instructor Pilot’s activity is canceled, he will be assigned instructional reserve days as provided in <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11N14">Section 11.N.14.</a></p>
      <p>7. An Instructor Pilot shall not be scheduled to perform instructor duties during non-instructional bid periods without his consent. If he consents to perform those duties he shall be removed from his conflicting scheduled trip(s) and/or R-day(s) as necessary to perform such duties, and shall be paid in accordance with <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11N25aiv">Section 11.N.25.a.iv.</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11N25av">v.</a>, as applicable.</p>
      <p>8. The Company shall not place an Instructor Pilot in pay only status for more than 2 consecutive bid periods without his concurrence. However, if it is necessary to place an Instructor Pilot in pay only status for more than 2 consecutive bid periods, the Company may fill those requirements in inverse seniority order.</p>
      <p>9. In order to provide an opportunity for pay only Instructor Pilots to maintain line proficiency in their respective aircraft, the following shall apply:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>a.   During an Instructor Pilot’s third consecutive pay only bid period, he shall be scheduled for 2 PDO fly days in lieu of scheduled training events, subject to the limitations contained in <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11N10">Section 11.N.10.</a> (PDO Bid Period). Due to the lengths of trips in certain domiciles, PDO fly days may be pooled to accommodate a trip longer than 2 days.</p>
        <p>b.   During an Instructor Pilot’s fourth consecutive pay only bid period, he shall have eligibility equal to the CH value of 2 R-days (or a minimum of 4:30 CHs/day) available to him in the Secondary Working Window (SWW) (See <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E6">Section 25.E.6.</a>) (SWW Bid Period). The Instructor Pilot’s schedule shall include 2 fewer instructional days in an SWW Bid Period, unless deferred in accordance with <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11N11b">Section 11.N.11.b.</a></p>
        <p>c.   For each additional consecutive pay only bid period, the Instructor Pilot’s proficiency flying eligibility shall alternate between PDO and SWW Bid Periods. When an Instructor Pilot flexes back to line flying (i.e., is awarded a line for flying purposes) and he subsequently flexes back to his instructional duties (i.e., is awarded a line for pay only purposes), he will again be eligible for proficiency flying after his 3rd consecutive pay only bid period. However, he will resume the alternating proficiency flying pattern established when he was last eligible for proficiency flying.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Example: An Instructor Pilot is scheduled for 4 consecutive pay only instructional bid periods (January, February, March, and April). March shall be a PDO Bid Period and April shall be a SWW Bid Period.</p>
          <p>Example: An Instructor Pilot is scheduled for 3 consecutive pay only instructional bid periods (January, February, and March). March shall be a PDO Bid Period. In April, the Instructor Pilot is flexed back to line flying. The Instructor Pilot is flexed back to instructional activities in May and is scheduled for 4 consecutive pay only instructional bid periods (May, June, July, and August). July shall be a SWW Bid Period and August shall be a PDO Bid Period.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>d.   In order to maintain currency, proficiency with line operating policies and procedures, and enhance his professional capabilities, each Instructor Pilot shall seek to attain 100 block hours (reducible by 2 hours per landing) per calendar year in the crew status in which he conducts training.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p id="link_11N10" class="link_highlight">10.    The following shall apply to all Instructor Pilots during a PDO Bid Period:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>a.   An Instructor Pilot may bump another pilot from his assigned trip(s) in order to maintain his proficiency in the crew status in which he conducts training.</p>
        <p>b.   No pilot may be bumped without his consent.</p>
        <p>c.   An Instructor Pilot may PDO bump a pilot in any base.</p>
        <p>d.   An Instructor Pilot may bump a seat in which he is qualified but cannot hold based on his system seniority, but only if an LCA, SCA, or PCA (who is a Captain by seniority) occupies the other seat.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p id="link_11N11" class="link_highlight">11.    The following shall apply to all Instructor Pilots during a SWW Bid Period:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>a.   An Instructor Pilot’s schedule shall include 2 fewer days, unless deferred as provided in Section 11.N.11.b.</p>
        <p id="link_11N11b" class="link_highlight">b.   An Instructor Pilot may defer the schedule reduction that otherwise would occur, in accordance with Section 11.N.11.a., in order to be entitled – in a subsequent, pay only bid period – to an aggregate schedule reduction of no more than 8 days.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Example: An Instructor Pilot is placed in pay only status for a third consecutive bid period (which, based on the pattern established in <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11N9">Section 11.N.9.</a>, is an SWW Bid Period), and as such is entitled to a 2-day schedule reduction. He elects to defer that reduction, so his instructional schedule is not reduced. During his next SWW Bid Period, he elects not to defer, and also elects to use the previously deferred 2-day reduction. His training schedule for that bid period will be reduced by a total of 4 days.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>c.   An Instructor Pilot will have corresponding proficiency (PRO) flying eligibility during the SWW (see <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_25E6">Section 25.E.6.</a>) as follows:</p>

For each day by which a pay only Instructor Pilot’s schedule is reduced, as provided in Section 11.N.11.a., as applicable, the CH value of an R-day (or a minimum of 4:30 CH) shall be available for participation in the Secondary Working Window (SWW), and a corresponding, temporary BLG reduction shall also occur (subject to the proficiency flying/secondary line process immediately below);</p>
          <p>ii.    The eligibility will also include the CHs previously deferred as provided in Section 11.N.11.b., but in no case shall the eligibility exceed 36 CH (at which time the pilot must exercise his PRO flying eligibility);</p>
          <p>iii.   During the SWW, this eligibility may be used to preference trips from open time, which will be assigned using the PRO assignment code. The pilot may not voluntarily use, toward his secondary line construction, standby trips, R-day blocks, or Relief Flight Officer (RFO/RF2) trips. The PRO assignment code will have the same pay characteristics as TRP;</p>
          <p>iv.    PRO eligibility shall be exercised at the pilot’s relative seniority;</p>
          <p>v. PRO eligibility may be exceeded by as much as 9 CH for each bid period in which such eligibility is exercised; and</p>
          <p>vi.    When an Instructor Pilot is assigned to an R-day(s), through this process, he shall either:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>(a)  notify his Training manager, no later than the last Friday prior to the start of the bid period in which such R-day(s) occur, to have such R-day(s) be dropped without pay and eligible for make-up; or</p>
            <p>(b)  have zero leveling on the first such R-day, and shall be in First Fly status for each such R-day.</p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p>d.   In no event shall a pilot begin a pay only SWW bid period below the applicable Minimum Bid Period Guarantee, subject to the provisions of <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_4A">Section 4.A.</a></p>

In anticipation of an instructional bid period, for Instructor Pilots (and certain Check Airman, as provided in <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11M11f">Section 11.M.11.f.</a>) who are not initially scheduled for instructional duties or evaluations in an aircraft:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>a.   Training schedules shall be published at least 120 hours prior to the start of the bid period.</p>
        <p>b.   During an instructional bid period, the Company shall construct a schedule of instructional duty days for each Instructor Pilot, and the following shall apply:</p>

      <p>1. The Company selection of such pilot candidates to undergo type rating and Check Airman training must occur prior to the introduction of a new aircraft into revenue service. A pilot who did not bid the new aircraft in the initial System Bid and could have held such position, shall not be eligible to be an initial cadre Check Airman.</p>
      <p>2. Initial cadre Check Airmen candidates who hold the crew status on the initial System Bid.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>a.   After the closing of the initial System Bid, the Company shall notify the MEC Chairman in writing of those initial cadre Check Airmen candidates that have been awarded crew positions in the new aircraft in accordance with the provisions of Section 24 of the CBA within 60 days of the award.</p>
        <p>b.   Initial cadre Check Airmen candidates who receive an award on the initial new aircraft System Bid (i.e., the candidate is awarded the necessary crew status to perform his duties as described in Section 11) shall be considered “Check Airmen.”</p>
        <p>c.   Check Airmen will use normal bidding processes for BLG and schedule determination in accordance with the provisions of <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11M5">Section 11.M.5.</a>, as applicable.

Then, however, Pilot A is assigned from the A300 CAP seat to the MD-11 F/O seat. Pilot A is compensated as a 757 CAP under <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11O2dii">Section 11.O.2.d.ii.</a> in the same manner as that by which the “Nth” CIPPA positions are determined, as provided in <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11Q3a">Section 11.Q.3.a.</a> (using MD-11 F/O as the “applicable crew position”).</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p id="link_11O2ei" class="link_highlight">i. If the pilot holds no other award/assignment, he shall be placed in the crew position award/assignment he held immediately prior to the Check Airman crew status award and compensated accordingly; or</p>

        <p>a.   Initial cadre pilot candidates who are not able to hold an award in the initial new aircraft System Bid will be considered “Provisional Check Airmen” (or Provo). The Company may award Provos Captain crew positions as if they had been awarded such crew position from the initial new aircraft System Bid. Provos will be considered to hold a quasi-award to the new aircraft crew position for purposes of Sections 11.M. These positions will be in addition to the initial System Bid awards. The Company may use Provisional Check Airmen for a maximum of 24 bid periods beginning with the introduction of the new aircraft into revenue service.

        <p>b.   A Provo shall bid in a pay only status in his previous crew position until the Company publishes a bid period package for the new aircraft type, at which point the Provo shall bid for vacation in the new aircraft crew position, but shall receive average BLG (for pay only) for the new aircraft crew position. The Provo’s schedule shall be governed by the applicable provisions of Section 11 as if the Provo was bidding in pay only status.

        <p>b.   An initial cadre Check Airman shall be considered to be in the pool of pilots in the crew position for which the pilot is receiving the pay rate (e.g., a MD-11 MEM Captain, selected as an initial cadre pilot candidate, holds an award on the initial System Bid for the 757 MEM Captain, and receives, through the operation of <a target="_blank" href="http://fdx.alpa.org/portals/26/docs/2015_Contract/2015FDXCBA_web.html#link_11O">Section 11.O.</a>, the pay rate for an MD-11 Captain; if a System Bid publishes a Current Staffing Level greater than Maximum Staffing Level, in the MD-11 MEM Captain crew position, the pilot will be considered as participating in that pool, and not as a 757 MEM Captain). If the pilot’s participation in that System Bid was in the crew position for which the pilot is performing duties as a Check Airman, the Company may continue to use the pilot as a Check Airman if the pilot is re-designated a Provo. In such case, the Company may continue to use the (newly designated) Provo until the expiration of 24 months following the introduction of the new aircraft into revenue service or 6 months after the close of that System Bid, whichever is later.</p>

        <p>b. Reserve pilots, who have voluntarily indicated a preference, may be assigned to provide seat support during simulator validation/evaluation events.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>8. Any simulator training period may be audio or video recorded with the written permission of all the pilots involved; provided, however, that such audio or video recording is erased after being viewed and critiqued by the pilots involved. A validation/evaluation event shall not be audio or video recorded.</p>
      <p>9. A pilot assigned to occupy a crew seat in support of another pilot’s training session/validation/evaluation event is not required to participate in the ground validation (e.g., walk-around inspection, emergency equipment) administered by the Instructor during the pre-simulator briefing. The assigned pilot shall satisfy the performance standards required by his crew status. Should the pilot flying seat support encounter any significant performance issues that require training (other than debrief), prior to his return to line flying, his case shall be referred to the TRB. A pilot shall not incur a training failure while occupying a seat in support of another pilot’s training.</p>

      <p>16. Except for de-identified training data, which is not covered by this paragraph, the Company shall retain only training records required by law (including FAA and other governmental agency regulation(s)).</p>
      <p>17. A pilot may have Association representation at any conference with management involving unsatisfactory training performance. Meetings shall not be delayed unreasonably because of the need for representation.</p>
      <p>18. Proficiency Enhancement Partnership Program</p>
      <p>As part of its proficiency enhancement partnership program, the Company will offer the following additional training for proficiency (non-jeopardy training) at the pilot’s election and subject to availability. This training is entirely voluntary on the pilot’s part. The pilot shall not be paid for this training, nor shall it count as duty or a day of work for purposes of this Agreement. The Company shall make a good faith effort to accommodate a pilot’s request for scheduling this type of training, however, this training shall not be scheduled to create a conflict with any other scheduled activities, and will be subject to device and instructor availability. The Company shall offer the following two types of training pursuant to this program:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>a. ITU Audit</p>
        <p>A pilot holding an ITU award may audit ground school before the commencement of his training, and may select PRO, MAN, and OE events subject to the discretion of the training manager.</p>
        <p>b. Proficiency Enhancement</p>
        <p>Up to two times per year, a pilot may request proficiency enhancement training. Pilots shall not request proficiency enhancement training to occur within 30 days of scheduled recurrent training.</p>

    <p><strong>A.   Preliminary Matters</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 19.A.1." rel="tooltip">1.</span> Discipline is defined as Letters of Warning, Suspensions, Terminations, and any other action taken by flight management resulting in a loss of pay or benefits to which the pilot would otherwise be entitled.</p>
  <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 19.A.2." rel="tooltip">2.</span> Counseling sessions and Advisory Letters do not constitute disciplinary action and may not be grieved. An Advisory letter is a non-disciplinary form letter issued to a pilot to communicate policy, procedures or work rules, which if violated in the future, could lead to discipline.</p>
  <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 19.A.3." rel="tooltip">3.</span> Standard for Discipline</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 19.A.3.a." rel="tooltip">a.</span>   The discipline standard for non-probationary pilots shall be “just cause.”</p>
    <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 19.A.3.b." rel="tooltip">b.</span>   Probationary pilots shall be considered to be employed on an “at will” basis for purposes of administering and reviewing discipline.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>B.   Documentation</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 19.B.1." rel="tooltip">1.</span> The Company shall provide a pilot with a copy of any written record of disciplinary action or advisory letter within 10 days after that record is placed in his personnel file.</p>
  <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 19.B.2." rel="tooltip">2.</span> A pilot shall have 60 days from the date on which the written record is received or reasonably should have been received, to place a written response concerning that action in his personnel file.</p>
  <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 19.B.3." rel="tooltip">3.</span> A pilot may examine his personnel file on any business day during normal business hours with adequate notice to his Fleet Captain.</p>
  <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 19.B.4." rel="tooltip">4.</span> An irregularity report or documents referring to an irregularity report (except for Advisory or Disciplinary Letters) shall not be placed in a pilot’s personnel file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="link_19C"><strong>C.   Consideration of Prior Disciplinary Action</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>An Advisory Letter or a Disciplinary Letter (e.g., a letter of warning, suspension, or termination) may be used to establish that a pilot was given notice of a policy, procedure or work rule, and/or that discipline could result from future violations of such policy, procedure or work rule, no matter the date of issuance of such Letter.</p>
  <p>An Advisory or Disciplinary Letter shall not serve as a basis for discipline after a period of 1 year during which the pilot receives no further Advisory or Disciplinary Letters. However, an Advisory or Disciplinary Letter may be considered in assessing future discipline involving similar misconduct for up to 2 years after the receipt of the most recent Advisory or Disciplinary Letter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>D.   Investigation</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 19.D.1." rel="tooltip">1.</span> The Company shall investigate and understand a pilot’s performance and conduct before taking any disciplinary action against that pilot. Part of a proper investigation may include management talking or meeting with a pilot or group of pilots to determine the facts and circumstances surrounding a situation. Depending on the circumstances of the particular case, some or all of the necessary fact gathering may occur prior to or without the need for a hearing of any type.</p>
  <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 19.D.2." rel="tooltip">2.</span> A pilot may request Association representation at a Company investigatory interview/meeting. When a pilot makes such a request, the Company shall either:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 19.D.2.a." rel="tooltip">a.</span> afford the pilot the opportunity to secure Association representation before initiating or continuing the interview/meeting;</p>
    <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 19.D.2.b." rel="tooltip">b.</span>   refrain from or discontinue the interview/meeting immediately; or</p>
    <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 19.D.2.c." rel="tooltip">c.</span>   offer the pilot the choice of either continuing the interview/meeting without Association representation or rescheduling the interview/meeting within a reasonable period of time, to allow the pilot the opportunity to arrange for Association representation.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 19.D.3." rel="tooltip">3.</span> Under no circumstances shall flight management require a pilot to submit to a psychological or psychiatric examination. However, a pilot may be required to undergo a psychological/psychiatric examination if directed by the Company’s aeromedical advisors, in accordance with Section 15.</p>

      <p>Substitution provisions apply only prior to block-out on a trip. Substitution shall not occur due to Company actions made for operational reasons (e.g., trip revision, high minimums pull) after block-out. A pilot who blocks out on a trip, but returns prior to making a landing at another airport, or who never blocks out due to an operational emergency, may be eligible for substitution, as if he had not blocked out.</p>

      <p>A pilot is eligible for substitution if he is removed from a trip for which he is entitled to trip guarantee for any of the reasons listed in this paragraph. Pilots in MUV, MUS, CMU, AFB, VLT, DRF or reserve are not eligible for substitution. If a pilot is removed from a substitution trip for any of the reasons listed in this paragraph, he shall remain eligible for substitution based upon his original trip (i.e., the trip or series of trips that actually created the substitution eligibility).

At the Association&rsquo;s request, the Company and the Company&rsquo;s actuary will meet with the Association and the Association&rsquo;s actuary to present and review the Company actuary&rsquo;s detailed analysis. The Association may provide comments on such analysis by July 7, and the Company&rsquo;s actuary will consider such comments in making its final determination of total projected costs.

For purposes of this provision, a pilot&rsquo;s pre-disability income shall be measured as the average earnings (Company and outside earned income) over the 12 months immediately preceding the pilot&rsquo;s disability.</p>
      <p>For example, a pilot programs software as a side business in addition to flying. He breaks his arm on July 1, 2016, and goes on LTD disability after his sick leave runs out on September 1, 2016. Between July 1, 2015, and July 1, 2016, the pilot made $100,000 as a FedEx pilot and $25,000 in his software business, for a monthly average total of $10,416.66. While on disability, the pilot continues to program software and makes $4,000 per month in addition to drawing a monthly disability of $5,000.00 (for the first 24 months; $4,166 thereafter) from the Company. The $9,000.00 monthly average income is below the $10,416.66 he earned before his disability, so no offset is required. If however, the pilot earned $7,000 per month in the software business, then his total monthly earnings ($12,000.00) would exceed his combined pre-disability monthly income ($10,416.66) by $1,583.34. In this situation, a monthly disability reduction of 50% of the $1,583.34, or $791.67 per month would be required.</p>

    <p>Pilots will be able to make HSA contributions up to the limits established by law. HSAs established under Section 27 shall allow for participant-directed investment to the maximum extent allowed under HealthEquity&rsquo;s (or any successor vendor&rsquo;s) guidelines.</p>

  <p id="link_29A1" class="link_highlight"><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 29.A.1." rel="tooltip">1.</span> As limited by the letter regarding Transition to Union Security dated August 26, 2006, each pilot covered by the Agreement who fails to acquire and maintain membership in the Association will be required, as a condition of continued employment, beginning 60 days following the completion of his probationary period, to pay to the Association each month a service charge as a contribution for the administration of the Agreement and the representation of the pilot. The Association has established that the service charge shall be an amount equal to the Association&rsquo;s regular dues and periodic assessments. In calculation of each non-member&rsquo;s monthly obligation, the Association will allocate and adjust charges in the same manner it followed with respect to its members.</p>
  <p id="link_29A2" class="link_highlight"><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 29.A.2." rel="tooltip">2.</span> The provisions of this Section will not apply to any pilot covered by the Agreement to whom membership in the Association is not available upon the same terms and conditions as are applicable to any other pilot, or to any pilot to whom membership in the Association was denied or terminated for any reason other than the failure of the pilot to pay initiation (or reinstatement) fee, dues and assessments uniformly required.</p>
  <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 29.A.3." rel="tooltip">3.</span> If a pilot covered by this Agreement is delinquent, or becomes delinquent in the payment of fees, dues and assessments or the service charge as stated in <a target="_blank" href="#link_29A1">Section 29.A.1.</a>, the Association will notify him with a copy to the Vice President, Flight Operations, or his designee, and the designated Company official in Labor Relations, that the pilot is delinquent and not complying with contract requirements and may be subject to separation from employment. Such letter will also notify the pilot that he must remit the required payment within a grace period of 15 days or risk being separated from employment.</p>
  <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 29.A.4." rel="tooltip">4.</span> If, upon the expiration of the 15 day grace period, the pilot remains delinquent, the following procedure shall be followed:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 29.A.4.a." rel="tooltip">a.</span>   The Association will give written notification to the Vice President, Flight Operations, or his designee, and the designated Company official in Labor Relations, with a copy to the pilot, that the pilot has failed to remit payment within the grace period and may be subject to separation from employment as a pilot. The Association&rsquo;s notice will be accompanied by a packet of the letters sent to the pilot regarding the dues delinquency, and pilot responses to same, and along with all other relevant documentation in its possession regarding the delinquency matter.</p>
    <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 29.A.4.b." rel="tooltip">b.</span>   Upon receipt of such notification, the Vice President, Flight Operations, or his designee, and the designated Company official in Labor Relations, may require a meeting with the pilot and a representative of the Association. The Vice President, Flight Operations, or his designee, shall determine whether there was a compelling reason why the pilot remains delinquent in his dues. If no such reason exists, then the Vice President, or his designee, shall separate the pilot from employment. The existence of a compelling reason for the delinquency does not excuse the pilot from the obligation to rectify the delinquency; rather the Vice President, or his designee, shall propose an arrangement plan tailored to the specific situation, and if the pilot fails to agree to such plan, he shall be separated from employment.</p>
    <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 29.A.4.c." rel="tooltip">c.</span>   Within 30 days of receipt of such notification the Vice President, Flight Operations, or his designee, and the designated Company official in Labor Relations, will give the pilot written notification of his employment status as a pilot. Any separation will automatically be held in abeyance for 10 days from the postmark date of mailing of the notification. If the pilot files an appeal in accordance with <a target="_blank" href="#link_29A4di">Section 29.A.4.d.i.</a>, the separation will be further held in abeyance pending the exhaustion of the appeal process in this Section. A pilot who is sent a separation notice will be placed on an unpaid personal leave of absence until the appeal process is final.</p>
    <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 29.A.4.d." rel="tooltip">d.</span>   If the decision regarding the pilot&rsquo;s employment status, including any separation from employment, is not satisfactory to either the pilot or the Association&rsquo;s Vice President-Finance/Treasurer, either may file an appeal. Such appeal will be subject to the following procedure, which will be exclusive of the provisions of Sections 19, 20, and 21.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p id="link_29A4di" class="link_highlight"><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 29.A.4.d.i." rel="tooltip">i.</span> The appeal shall be sent to the Company, to the other party and to the National Mediation Board (NMB) within 10 days of the receipt of the decision and must contain a request for the NMB to provide a list of 7 neutral referees.</p>
      <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 29.A.4.d.ii." rel="tooltip">ii.</span>    A neutral referee may be agreed upon by the pilot and the Association&rsquo;s Legal Department Director within 20 days following the date of the NMB list of neutral referees. If the parties cannot agree on a neutral referee, within the same 20 day period, a neutral referee shall be chosen from the panel supplied by the NMB using the alternate strike method with the pilot initiating the first strike. If the parties have not reached a selection using the alternate strike method within the same 20 day period, the first name listed on the 7 name panel provided by the NMB shall be deemed the neutral referee.</p>
      <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 29.A.4.d.iii." rel="tooltip">iii.</span>   The decision of the neutral referee will be requested within 30 days after the hearing of the appeal unless otherwise agreed by the pilot and the Association&rsquo;s Legal Department Director and will be final and binding on all parties to the dispute. The fees, charges and other reasonable expenses of such neutral referee will be paid equally by the pilot and the Association.</p>

<p><strong>B.   Check Off</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 29.B.1." rel="tooltip">1.</span> The Company agrees to deduct from the pay of each employee covered by the Agreement, and remit to the Association promptly upon such deduction, membership dues, assessments by the Association, assessments by the FedEx MEC, insurance premiums, and service charges uniformly levied, in accordance with the Constitution and By-Laws of the Association, all as prescribed by the Railway Labor Act, as amended, provided such employee voluntarily executes authorization on a form (checkoff form) supplied by the Association. An example of such checkoff form is provided below. If technical or space limitations preclude a complete listing of all the itemized deductions on a pilot&rsquo;s payroll stub, some Association deductions may be combined on the stub entry, if and where possible, or the parties may meet and consult to determine the appropriate method to satisfy the limitation problem.</p>
  <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 29.B.2." rel="tooltip">2.</span> All checkoff forms shall be submitted to the Association&rsquo;s Membership and Council Services Department, which shall forward the original to the Company&rsquo;s designated representative. Checkoff forms so received by the Company&rsquo;s designated representative shall be stamp-dated on the date received and shall constitute notice to the Company on the date received and not when mailed. A properly executed checkoff form shall become effective as of the first payroll period of a calendar month commencing 15 days following its receipt by the Company. In accordance with applicable law, the Association will conform requests for payroll deductions to valid checkoff forms.</p>
  <p id="link_29B3" class="link_highlight"><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 29.B.3." rel="tooltip">3.</span> Any notice of revocation as set forth in the checkoff form must be in writing, signed by the pilot, and submitted to the Association&rsquo;s Supervisor, Membership and Council Services Department by Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested, with a copy to the FedEx MEC Secretary-Treasurer. The Association&rsquo;s Membership and Council Services Department shall forward the original to the Company&rsquo;s designated representative. Notices of revocation are effective as of the first payroll period of a calendar month commencing 15 days following receipt of such revocation by the Association.</p>
  <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 29.B.4." rel="tooltip">4.</span> The Company shall collect dues and assessments from pilots who elected dues and assessments checkoff in the paychecks issued on the 15th and last day of each month and any &ldquo;off-cycle&rdquo; paychecks. Following the processing of payroll on the 15th and last day of each month, the Company shall remit to the Association the funds collected pursuant to this provision since the previous remittance.</p>
  <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 29.B.5." rel="tooltip">5.</span> The Company shall forward an electronic record of each deduction type (dues, assessments, service charges (not including assessments), insurance premiums, and arrangement plans). The record shall identify the date of the covered payroll period, each pilot for whom an Association-related deduction was made, each pilot&rsquo;s employee number, and the amount of each pilot&rsquo;s deduction. The electronic record for dues and service charge deductions shall also include the amount of a pilot&rsquo;s earnings during the current payroll cycle that are subject to dues.</p>
  <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 29.B.6." rel="tooltip">6.</span> A pilot&rsquo;s checkoff form shall be deemed to have been revoked effective upon:</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>Further deductions for such pilot, if any, shall be made only upon execution and receipt of another checkoff form, except that a furloughee shall have deductions begin again upon his return to active service, unless he provides written notice of revocation as provided above.</p>
  <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 29.B.7." rel="tooltip">7.</span> This Agreement shall not be construed to revoke or cancel any FedEx checkoff form executed prior to the effective date of the Agreement.</p>
  <p><span class="tooltipline" title="Section 29.B.8." rel="tooltip">8.</span> Collection of any back dues owed at the time of starting deductions for any employee, collection of dues missed because the employee&rsquo;s earnings were not sufficient to cover the payment of dues in the specified pay period and dues owed because of errors by ALPA in the accounting procedure will be the responsibility of the Association and not the Company. The Association will make every effort to verify apparent errors with the individual Association member or pilot employee before contacting the Company&rsquo;s designated representative for dues and service charge deduction issues. In cases where a deduction is made which duplicates a payment already made to the Association by an employee, or where a deduction is not in conformity with the provisions of the Association&rsquo;s Constitution and By-Laws or <a target="_blank" href="#section29">Section 29</a> of this Agreement, refunds to the employees will be made by the Association.</p>

  <p>This Letter of Agreement (&ldquo;LOA&rdquo;) is made and entered into in accordance with the provisions of Title II of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, by and between FEDERAL EXPRESS CORPORATION (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) and the pilots in the service of FEDERAL EXPRESS CORPORATION, as represented by the AIR LINE PILOTS ASSOCIATION, INTERNATIONAL (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Association&rdquo;).</p>
  <p>WHEREAS, the Company and the Association are parties to a collective bargaining agreement setting forth the rates of pay, rules, and working conditions for the Company&rsquo;s pilots (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;basic Agreement&rdquo;), effective on November 2, 2015, and</p>
  <p>WHEREAS, the Company and the Association agree that the following terms and conditions shall govern Foreign Duty Assignments (<a id="_idTextAnchor475"></a>hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;FDAs<a id="_idTextAnchor476"></a>&rdquo;) in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;EMEA&rdquo;) and Hong Kong (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;HKG&rdquo;).</p>
  <p>NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:</p>
  <p><strong>A. Authorized FDAs and Establishing a New FDA in the EMEA</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. This LOA authorizes the Company to center FDAs in:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>a. Hong Kong (HKG);</p>
      <p>b. Cologne, Germany (CGN); and</p>
      <p>c. Paris, France (CDG), provided, however, that if the Company establishes an FDA in CDG under this LOA, the housing allowance shall be determined in accordance with Paragraph A.2.d. of this LOA below.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>2. The Company may establish a new FDA in the EMEA, if agreed upon in writing by the Association&rsquo;s MEC Chairman and the Vice President of Flight Operations under the following conditions:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>a. The Company shall notify the Association&rsquo;s MEC Chairman, in writing, of the location and anticipated date the Company plans to begin staffing the FDA.</p>
      <p>b. The FDA is centered at an airport located in Switzerland, <a id="_idTextAnchor494"></a>Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Spain, the Netherlands, or Belgium.</p>
      <p>c. The location is determined to be acceptable from a safety, security, and accessibility standpoint.</p>
      <p>d. A housing allowance is provided to pilots assigned to the FDA that is not less than $3,500, which shall be adjusted for the difference in the cost-of-living between CGN and the location of the new FDA, as follows:</p>
      <p>i. The Baseline Maximum Per Diem Rate (BMPDR) for the CGN FDA (as defined in Paragraph C.2.d.i.(c) of this LOA) and the Maximum Per Diem Rate (MPDR) for the new EMEA FDA location shall be sampled on the date the Company notifies the Association that it plans to establish a new EMEA FDA.</p>
      <p>ii.    The initial housing allowance in the new EMEA FDA location shall be based on the ratio between the most recent housing allowance in the CGN FDA and the corresponding BMPDR for CGN, when compared to the MPDR for the new EMEA FDA location (rounded to the nearest whole dollar).</p>
      <p>iii.   The minimum monthly housing allowance for the new EMEA FDA location shall be based on the ratio between the MPDR in the CGN FDA and the MPDR in the new EMEA FDA location, when compared to $3,500 (rounded to the nearest whole dollar).</p>
      <p>e. The terms and conditions of this LOA applicable to the FDA centered in CGN shall apply to a new EMEA FDA.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>3. Provided that the prerequisites of Paragraph A.2. of this LOA are satisfied, the Association&rsquo;s agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Company shall have the burden of proof and persuasion in a proceeding in which this provision is contested.</p>
    <p>4.   Nothing in this LOA shall be construed to limit the Company&rsquo;s ability to establish an FDA in accordance with Section 6 of the basic Agreement.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>B. Crew Posistions in FDAs</strong></p>
  <p>Crew Positions for FDAs in the EMEA or in HKG shall be posted, bid upon and awarded as provided in Section 24 of the basic Agreement with the following modifications:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. In any notification of a System Bid, the Company shall also include any known restriction related to the EMEA or HKG FDAs.</p>
    <p>2. The down/lateral bid restrictions set forth in <a target="_blank" href="#link_24F1">Section 24.F.1.</a> of the basic Agreement shall be waived with respect to pilots bidding for FDA crew positions.</p>
    <p id="link_FDAB3" class="link_highlight">3. In order to list an FDA crew position on his standing bid, a pilot must sign an FDA Personal Agreement (hereinafter &ldquo;Personal Agreement&rdquo;), agreed upon by the parties (Attachment A), which provides, in part, that, if the pilot is awarded an FDA crew position, the terms and conditions of his employment while assigned to the FDA will be governed by the basic Agreement and applicable laws of the United States and not by the laws of the country where the FDA is located.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>a. Pilots listing an FDA crew position on their standing bid will be provided with an electronic copy of the Personal Agreement, which the pilot must sign and submit electronically to the Company.</p>
      <p>b. If an FDA pilot violates any aspect of the FDA Personal Agreement:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i. The pilot may, at the Company&rsquo;s option, be assigned to a non-FDA crew position consistent with the pilot&rsquo;s seniority. Such pilot&rsquo;s assignment (as that term is defined in Section 24) to a non-FDA crew position and/or his assignment (as that term is defined in Section 24) to an ITU training date/slot (if any such training is required) shall not generate an SDP or an inverse SDP for any pilot.</p>
        <p>ii. Nothing in this Paragraph shall be construed so as to limit any action the Company might take under Sections 19, 20, and 21 related to a pilot&rsquo;s violation of the Personal Agreement.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>4. Visas and Other Required Credentials</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>a. The Company shall cover the cost of obtaining visas and other official credentials that are required for an FDA pilot (i.e., a pilot activated in an FDA crew position) to live and/or work in the FDA (e.g., residence and work visas, HKG Identification Card, etc.).</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i.   To the extent that members of the pilot&rsquo;s immediate family (as that term is defined in Section 6 of the basic Agreement) relocate with him to the FDA, the Company shall also cover the cost of such visas and other official credentials that are required for those members of the pilot&rsquo;s immediate family to live in the FDA.</p>
        <p>Absent extenuating circumstances, if the Company obtains such visas and credentials for members of the pilot&rsquo;s immediate family who do not relocate to the FDA thereafter, the pilot shall reimburse the Company for the cost of obtaining such visas and credentials.</p>
        <p>ii.  Pilots shall coordinate and cooperate with the Company&rsquo;s designated representatives for the purpose of securing said visas and credentials.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>b. If, having been awarded an FDA crew position, a pilot is unable to secure or maintain any required visa or credentials for himself, he shall contact his Fleet Captain immediately and shall be released from his FDA crew position award.</p>
      <p>c. If a member of the pilot&rsquo;s immediate family is unable to secure or maintain the required visas or credentials, the pilot may elect to be released from his FDA crew position award by submitting an appropriate explanation to the System Chief Pilot (or his designee). The timing of the release shall be determined by the System Chief Pilot (or his designee), after consultation with the pilot, and shall balance the pilot&rsquo;s desires with the Company&rsquo;s operational requirements.</p>
      <p id="link_FDAB4d" class="link_highlight">d. The crew position of a pilot who was released from his FDA crew position award as described in Paragraph B.4.c. of this LOA shall be determined as provided in <a target="_blank" href="#link_13A6bii">Section 13.A.6.b.ii.</a> of the basic Agreement as if the pilot had been on a leave of absence when the System Bid on which he was awarded his FDA crew position closed. Such pilot&rsquo;s assignment (as that term is defined in Section 24) to a new crew position and assignment (as that term is defined in Section 24) to an ITU training date/slot (if any such training is required) shall not generate an SDP or an inverse SDP for any pilot.</p>
      <p>e. The pilot&rsquo;s inability to secure or maintain required visas or credentials shall not, by itself, constitute grounds for penalty or discipline.</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>C. Relocation Package Options in the EMEA and HKG FDAs</strong></p>
  <p>Except as provided in Paragraph O. of this LOA within 15 days after being awarded a crew position in an FDA, a pilot shall choose from either the &ldquo;Existing CBA Option&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Enhanced Option&rdquo; set forth in Paragraph C.1. and C.2. of this LOA, respectively.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Existing CBA Option (3 year commitment)</p>
    <p>Pilots who choose the Existing CBA Option shall be entitled to the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>a. Relocation benefits as described in Section 6 of the basic Agreement, except that <a target="_blank" href="#link_6E1e">Section 6.E.1.e.</a> (FDA Bonus) shall be inapplicable.</p>
      <p>b. Tax equalization as provided in Paragraph E. of this LOA.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>2. Enhanced Option (2 year commitment)</p>
    <p>Pilots selecting the Enhanced Option shall be entitled to the following benefits, in lieu of the benefits available under Section 6 of the basic Agreement. Unless specifically provided for below, provisions in Section 6 of the basic Agreement shall not be applicable to HKG and EMEA FDA pilots who elect the Enhanced Option.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>a. Seed Money</p>
      <p>Pilots who select the enhanced option shall be entitled to a one-time payment of <a id="_idTextAnchor531"></a>$10,000 which shall be paid upon:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i. a pilot&rsquo;s activation into his FDA crew position; and</p>
        <p>ii. the Company&rsquo;s receipt of all required documentation, including documentation required for the processing of the tax equalization program and all necessary immigration paperwork.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>b. Four Year Service Credit</p>
      <p>If a pilot completes 48 months as an active pilot in the same FDA, he shall receive an additional payment of $5,000. This payment shall be made within 30 days after the pilot completes his 48th month as an active pilot in the FDA. If a pilot upgrades within the FDA, time spent in ITU training will not be counted toward the 48 months. A pilot may receive more than one 48 month service credit payment during his assignment to the FDA (e.g., if a HKG FDA pilot completes 96 months as an active pilot in the HKG FDA, he shall receive a second payment of $5,000, etc.).</p>
      <p>c. Storage</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i. A pilot shall be entitled to expenses associated with the storage of his household goods in the location of his pre-FDA domestic residence (i.e., his permanent, primary residence immediately preceding his assignment to the FDA) or, if approved in advance by the Relocation Department, a different domestic location involving no greater cost to the Company (using the cost of storage in the pilot&rsquo;s pre-FDA domestic location as the reference point). Reimbursement shall not exceed $4,000 per year and the storage must be at a commercial storage provider. In addition, the Company will assume the cost of packing such goods (subject to the standard limitations regarding the types of goods to be shipped/stored, which are catalogued in <a target="_blank" href="#link_6C1b">Section 6.C.1.b.</a>), and the cost of transporting them to and from the storage facility (local transportation only). Requests for reimbursement of storage fees must be submitted within 90 days of the date the expense was incurred, in accordance with the Company&rsquo;s standard procedures concerning expense reporting.</p>
        <p>ii.  A pilot may elect to waive reimbursement of domestic storage expenses and instead elect to ship up to 2,000 additional pounds of household goods in his initial and return household goods shipments pursuant to Paragraph C.2.h. of this LOA. This election shall be made during the pilot&rsquo;s &ldquo;FDA Assignment Window&rdquo; (i.e., the period beginning 60 days prior to his activation in his FDA crew position and ending 6 months after his activation in his FDA crew position) and shall apply for the duration of the pilot&rsquo;s assignment to the FDA.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>d. Housing Allowance</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i. Rental Allowance</p>
        <p>Pilots shall be entitled to a rental allowance as set forth below to offset the cost of renting a permanent, primary residence in the FDA location.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>(a) The monthly rental allowance in the HKG FDA shall be a minimum of $4,500.</p>
          <p>(b) The monthly rental allowance in the FDA centered in CGN shall be a minimum of $3,500.</p>
          <p>(c) Cost of Living Protection for EMEA FDA Rental Allowance</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>(1) The U.S. Department of State Foreign Maximum Per Diem Rate (MPDR) for the CGN FDA was sampled on March 1, 2011, which established the Baseline Maximum Per Diem Rate (BMPDR) of 388.</p>
            <p>(2)  Beginning on January 1 and July 1 of each calendar year following the effective date of this Agreement, the MPDR shall be sampled. If the sampled MPDR varies from the BMPDR by more than 5%, the Company shall adjust the EMEA FDA Rental Allowance by the percentage change in the MPDR (rounded to the nearest whole dollar). If the EMEA FDA Rental Allowance is changed pursuant to this mechanism, the MPDR on which the new housing allowance was based shall constitute the new BMPDR, which shall be published on the EUR FDA page of pilot.fedex.com.</p>
            <p>(3)  Any adjustment to the EMEA FDA Rental Allowance by operation of this paragraph shall be effective beginning in February and/or August, and shall be announced via FCIF at least 15 days prior to the first business day of February and/or August.</p>
            <p>(4)  In no event, however, shall the application of this paragraph result in a monthly rental allowance for the EMEA FDA of less than that set forth in Paragraph C.2.d.i.(b) of this LOA.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>(d)    Cost of Living Protection for HKG FDA Rental Allowance</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>(1)  On the effective date of this Agreement, the Company shall calculate a baseline Currency Exchange Rate Adjusted Rental Index (CERARI), as follows:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>(A)    The most recent, non-provisional Private Domestic – Class C Rental Index (prepared by the Rating and Valuation Department of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) (RI) shall be sampled. This shall be the &ldquo;baseline RI.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>(B)    The &ldquo;Average Buying Rate in Hong Kong Dollars&rdquo; (published by the Inland Revenue Department of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) (ABR) for the month used to determine the baseline RI shall also be sampled. This shall be the &ldquo;baseline ABR.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>(C)    The baseline RI shall be divided by the baseline ABR to determine the baseline CERARI, which shall be published on the HKG FDA page of pilot.fedex.com.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>(2)  Beginning on January 1 and July 1 of each calendar year following the effective date of this Agreement, the Company shall calculate a new CERARI using the same methodology set forth in Paragraph C.2.d.i.(d)(1). If the calculated CERARI on that day varies from the baseline CERARI by more than 5%, the Company shall adjust the HKG FDA Rental Allowance by the percentage change in the CERARI (rounded to the nearest whole dollar). If the HKG FDA Rental Allowance is adjusted pursuant to this mechanism, the CERARI on which the adjusted HKG FDA Rental Allowance was based shall constitute the new baseline CERARI, which shall also be published on the HKG FDA page of pilot.fedex.com.</p>
            <p>(3)  Any adjustment to the HKG FDA Rental Allowance by operation of this paragraph shall be effective beginning in February and/or August, and shall be announced via FCIF at least 15 days prior to the first business day of February and/or August.</p>
            <p>(4)  In no event, however, shall the application of this paragraph result in a monthly rental allowance for the HKG FDA of less than that set forth in Paragraph C.2.d.i.(a) of this LOA, nor shall the application of this paragraph result in a CERARI less than the baseline CERARI determined on the effective date of this Agreement.</p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p>ii.  Home Ownership Allowance. A pilot who chooses to own rather than rent a permanent, primary residence in the FDA shall be entitled to a monthly home ownership allowance of 50% of the minimum FDA rental housing allowance listed in Paragraph C.2.d.i.(a) and (b) of this LOA.</p>
        <p>iii. To be eligible for the housing allowance, a pilot must establish and maintain a permanent, primary residence in the country containing the airport at which the FDA base is centered (for purposes of this paragraph, HKG shall be considered part of China). Additionally, the pilot must occupy the housing for which an allowance is being paid. Standards for determining whether a pilot has relocated his permanent, primary residence under this paragraph shall be the same as for full relocations under Section 6 of the basic Agreement. The housing must be located within 100 nautical miles of the base airport. A larger radius may be approved on a case-by-case basis by the System Chief Pilot, if the proposed residence affords access to the hub airport that is at least as expeditious and reliable as comparable residences inside the 100 nm radius and is within the same country in which the FDA base airport is located.</p>
        <p>Note: The requirement that pilots establish and maintain a permanent, primary residence in the country containing the airport at which the FDA base is located shall not apply to pilots who elected the Enhanced Option and who relocated their permanent, primary residence to within 100 nm of the FDA base airport prior to February 28, 2011.</p>
        <p>iv. The housing allowance shall be paid the first month in which the pilot is assigned to the FDA and has secured a permanent, primary residence pursuant to Paragraph C.2.d.iii. of this LOA. In the first and last month of a pilot&rsquo;s assignment to the FDA, if the pilot is assigned to the FDA for less than a full month, his housing allowance for that month(s) shall be prorated.</p>
        <p>Upon request, a pilot must provide adequate substantiation that he has established and maintained his permanent, primary residence in the FDA, including, but not limited to, a lease agreement, canceled checks, or receipts.</p>
        <p>v. In cases of a pilot&rsquo;s persistent failure to maintain timely contact and completion of required documentation pertaining to the tax equalization program, the Company may suspend the pilot&rsquo;s housing allowance, provided however, that the Company gave the pilot prior notice of his delinquency and the pilot was given at least 60 days to rectify that delinquency.</p>
        <p>vi.  The pilot shall receive a pro-rated FDA housing allowance for 30 days after the date on which:</p>
        <p>(a)  the pilot&rsquo;s lease on his permanent, primary residence in the FDA expires (or is not renewed within 15 days of its expiration) or is terminated prior to its expiration date by the pilot or the pilot&rsquo;s landlord;</p>
        <p>(b)  the pilot ships his household goods from the FDA to his next residence in accordance with Paragraph C.2.h.ii. of this LOA; or</p>
        <p>(c)  the pilot uses or members of his immediate family use the Company provided de-positioning tickets to travel to the pilot&rsquo;s next residence in accordance with Paragraph C.2.f. of this LOA.</p>
        <p>A pilot is not eligible for FDA housing allowance payment(s) (full or pro-rated) after his activation in his new crew position.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>e. Tax equalization as provided in Paragraph E. of this LOA.</p>
      <p>f. Airline Tickets. All airline tickets authorized by this paragraph shall be purchased exclusively through the Company&rsquo;s travel vendor in coordination with the Relocation Department.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i.   The Company shall provide business class air travel to the pilot and the members of his immediate family relocating to the FDA with him:</p>

          <p>(a)    to the FDA base airport from his pre-FDA domestic residence during his FDA Assignment Window (&ldquo;positioning air travel&rdquo;); and</p>
          <p>(b)    from the FDA base airport (or a commercial passenger airport within 100 nm of the FDA base airport) to one of the following locations during his &ldquo;FDA Transition Window&rdquo; (i.e., the period beginning 6 months prior to his activation into his post-FDA crew position and ending upon either his activation in his new crew position or 60 days after termination of his employment, whichever is earlier) (&ldquo;de-positioning air travel&rdquo;):</p>

        <p id="link_FDAC2fiii" class="link_highlight">iii.  The Company shall establish a separate FDA air travel expense bank for each pilot entitled to airline tickets authorized by Paragraph C.2.f. The value of the pilot&rsquo;s FDA air travel expense bank shall be equal to the reference fare quote obtained by the Company&rsquo;s travel vendor pursuant to Paragraph C.2.f.iii.(b).</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>(a)    A pilot shall submit his positioning or de-positioning air travel request to the Relocation Department at least 21 days prior to the requested travel date.

          <p>(b) Within 3 days of the Relocation Department&rsquo;s receipt of the pilot&rsquo;s request for air travel authorized by this paragraph, the Company&rsquo;s travel vendor shall obtain a fare quote (&ldquo;reference fare quote&rdquo;) for the total cost of business class (for positioning/de-positioning tickets) or economy class (for annual home visit tickets) air travel for the pilot&rsquo;s entire traveling party between the reference destinations listed in Paragraph C.2.f.i. and ii. respectively. The Company&rsquo;s travel vendor shall transmit the reference fare quote electronically to the Company&rsquo;s Relocation and Crew Travel Audit Departments and to the pilot.</p>

The Company&rsquo;s travel vendor shall transmit the requested fare quote electronically to the pilot, at which time the pilot may purchase tickets for his requested itinerary (as quoted) or make alternative arrangements with the Company&rsquo;s travel vendor.</p>
          <p>(d)    If the pilot elects to travel on the &ldquo;reference&rdquo; itinerary, the pilot must purchase tickets from the Company&rsquo;s travel vendor within 3 days of the pilot&rsquo;s receipt of the reference fare quote.</p>

      <p>g. Commitment Period</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i. A pilot must complete two years as an active pilot in the FDA, unless released from his obligation due to extenuating circumstances by the Vice President, Flight Operations.</p>
        <p>ii. If a pilot fails to complete his commitment period without a release from the Vice President, Flight Operations, he shall be obligated to repay his seed money and any money paid by the Company for storage.</p>
        <p>iii. If a pilot changes or attempts to change his crew status within his FDA (e.g., upgrades from F/O/HKG to CAP/HKG), his original commitment period shall be extended by 12 months plus the time spent in training. In the EMEA FDA, however, a pilot may change his crew status in this manner only if the pilot can activate to the new seat and actually perform revenue operations in that seat for at least <a id="_idTextAnchor556"></a>12 months prior to the end of his EMEA FDA assignment. This restriction may be waived by the Vice President, Flight Operations, in extenuating circumstances.</p>
        <p>An extension of an FDA pilot&rsquo;s commitment period under this provision shall not be considered for purposes of determining a pilot&rsquo;s eligibility for annual home visit air travel benefits (Paragraph C.2.f.ii.) (i.e., the pilot&rsquo;s &ldquo;original&rdquo; commitment period shall be used to determine his eligibility for annual home visit air travel benefits – not the pilot&rsquo;s &ldquo;extended&rdquo; commitment period).</p>
        <p>iv. Furlough or Assignment</p>
        <p>In the event that an FDA pilot is furloughed or assigned (as that term is defined in Section 24) to a crew position and that pilot has contractual obligations associated with his rented permanent, primary residence (e.g., lease, utilities, mobile phone, internet, cable/television, and telephone) in the FDA that extend beyond his furlough date or his activation into his new crew position, the Company shall assume responsibility for reasonable and customary termination fees; provided, however, that the pilot provides the Company with a copy of any relevant agreement(s), has taken reasonable steps to mitigate or reduce the termination fees, and has fully cooperated with the Company in this regard.</p>
        <p>In addition, the Company shall reimburse educational expenses that the furloughed pilot is responsible for beyond the furlough date. Educational expenses for an FDA pilot assigned (as that term is defined in Section 24) to a crew position are subject to the provisions in Paragraph G.2. of this LOA.</p>
        <p>In the event that an FDA pilot is furloughed or assigned (as that term is defined in Section 24) to a crew position in a different geographic location, he shall be entitled to the relocation benefits set forth in <a target="_blank" href="#link_6E2bii">Section 6.E.2.b.ii.</a> or <a target="_blank" href="#link_6E2biii">iii.</a> of the basic Agreement (as appropriate).</p>

      <p>h. Household Goods Shipments</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i.   Initial Household Goods Shipment</p>
        <p>During an FDA pilot&rsquo;s FDA Assignment Window, he shall be entitled to a household goods shipment of 2,000 lbs. (or 4,000 lbs. if the pilot elected to waive reimbursement of domestic storage expenses pursuant to Paragraph C.2.c. of this LOA) from his pre-FDA domestic residence to his permanent, primary residence in the FDA. A pilot&rsquo;s initial household goods shipment shall be via FedEx Express International Economy (IE) service (or the most comparable such service if IE is discontinued).</p>
        <p>ii.  Return Household Goods Shipment</p>
        <p>During an FDA pilot&rsquo;s FDA Transition Window, he shall be eligible for a household goods shipment of 4,000 lbs. (or 6,000 lbs. if the pilot elected to waive reimbursement of domestic storage expenses pursuant to Paragraph C.2.c. of this LOA). A pilot&rsquo;s return household goods shipment shall be via either FedEx Express, on a space available basis, or by surface transportation if surface transportation offers more expeditious transit times than shipment by FedEx Express on a space available basis.</p>
        <p>Unless different locations are authorized by the Company&rsquo;s Relocation Department, return household goods shipments shall be, at the pilot&rsquo;s option, from the pilot&rsquo;s permanent, primary residence in the FDA to:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>(a)    his pre-FDA domestic residence;</p>

          <p>(c)    his new residence if located in a different location in the US involving no greater cost to the Company (using his pre-FDA domestic residence as the baseline).</p>
          <p>If a pilot chooses a location which exceeds the cost to the Company of shipping the pilot&rsquo;s household goods from his permanent, primary residence in the FDA to his pre-FDA domestic residence, the pilot shall be responsible for the additional cost of shipping to that location. This provision shall not limit or abridge any relocation rights which accrued to the pilot prior to his FDA assignment (e.g., rights accrued by SFS and ANC pilots under 1999 and 2006 Agreements).</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>iii. For all household goods shipments, this benefit shall include the cost of packing such goods, subject to the standard limitations regarding the types of goods to be shipped/stored, which are catalogued in <a target="_blank" href="#link_6C1b">Section 6.C.1.b.</a> of the basic Agreement, and the cost of transporting them as described above.</p>
        <p>iv.  For shipments of household goods by air, the pilot shall be responsible for the cost of shipping any excess dimensional weight if the dimensional weight exceeds both the actual weight and the maximum weight allowance. The dimensional weight for such shipments is calculated by multiplying the actual volume of the shipment (in cu. ft.) by 4.0 lbs./cu. ft.</p>
        <p>v.   Payment for any excess weight over the applicable weight limits or additional shipment costs associated with the destination of his household goods shipment shall be the sole responsibility of the pilot and shall be paid at the time of the move.</p>
        <p>vi.  Delayed household goods shipments shall be handled in accordance with <a target="_blank" href="#link_6C1a">Section 6.C.1.a.</a> of the basic Agreement.</p>
        <p>vii. Regardless of whether the pilot elected the Enhanced Option or the Existing CBA Option, the Company shall reimburse the pilot for the cost of a shipment of personal items (up to 100 lbs., but no more than $500) after the pilot&rsquo;s household goods are shipped from the FDA; provided, however, that the pilot ships his personal items using his FedEx employee discount/reduced-rate shipping account and submits a receipt/invoice within 30 days of the date of the shipment.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>i. In the event the Company closes an FDA, pilots who have not met their commitment period shall not be required to repay any seed money or monies paid by the Company for storage and shall be permitted to a return household goods shipment in accordance with Paragraph C.2.h.ii. of this LOA.</p>
      <p>j. Orientation and Housing Search Services</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i. During the first 30 days of a pilot&rsquo;s assignment to the FDA, the Company shall make available to FDA pilots local real estate and orientation assistance. This shall be provided through individuals who are fluent in the local language and who are familiar with the FDA location. This service may last up to four days and may be provided individually or in small groups.</p>
        <p>ii. In extraordinary circumstances, an additional day(s) may be approved by the Vice President, Flight Operations, or his designee. Any additional day(s) not approved by the Company shall be at the pilot&rsquo;s expense. A pilot may use his Company credit card to pay for any additional day(s) and the amount of the expenditure will be recovered through payroll deduction as provided in <a target="_blank" href="#link_3E1aiv">Section 3.E.1.a.iv.</a> of the basic Agreement.</p>
        <p>iii. The Company shall provide 6 months of ongoing telephonic support beginning the first day of onsite housing assistance provided to the pilot. This shall be provided through individuals who are fluent in the local language and who are familiar with the FDA location.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>k. Initial Residence upon Arrival</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i. During the first 30 days of a pilot&rsquo;s assignment to the EMEA FDA, he may be required to stay, at the Company&rsquo;s expense, in an extended stay hotel that has been jointly approved by the Company and the Association. To the extent that the daily cost of the hotel stay is less than $250, the Company will pay the pilot the difference between the cost of the hotel stay and $250.</p>
        <p>ii.  Pilots assigned to the HKG FDA (or the EMEA FDA if the pilots are not so required pursuant to Paragraph C.2.k.i. of this LOA) may elect to live in a local hotel for up to 30 nights in the first 60 days of his assignment. The Company will reimburse pilots making this election for the cost of hotel arrangements up to $250 per night.</p>
        <p>iii. In extraordinary circumstances, the Vice President, Flight Operations, or his designee, may approve additional days of hotel usage for pilots in the<a id="_idTextAnchor572"></a> FDA.</p>
        <p>iv. Payments for hotel stays pursuant to these provisions are in lieu of the housing allowance set forth in Paragraph C.2.d. of this LOA.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>l. Deposit Assistance</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i. The Company will provide one holding deposit per pilot per assignment to an FDA, arranged through the Company&rsquo;s vendor for facilitating relocations in the FDA. The holding deposit shall be offset against the pilot&rsquo;s deposit assistance benefit in Paragraph C.2.l.ii of this LOA, or his housing allowance in Paragraph C.2.d. of this LOA, as applicable. In the event a rental agreement is not consummated and the holding deposit, or portion thereof is forfeited, the Company may seek reimbursement from the pilot, unless the deposit was forfeited due to circumstances beyond the pilot&rsquo;s control. If a holding deposit is forfeited for reasons beyond a pilot&rsquo;s control, another holding deposit may be provided at the Company&rsquo;s discretion.</p>
        <p>ii.  If a landlord/lessor requires an advance deposit(s) as a requirement of leasing a permanent, primary residence in the FDA, the Company shall provide deposit assistance up to a maximum of $10,000 per pilot. The purpose of the deposit assistance is to mitigate the financial burden placed upon pilots who are required to supply advance deposits. The provision of the deposit assistance shall be on a tax free basis to the pilot.</p>
        <p>iii. In the event that a pilot is transitioning from one permanent, primary residence in the FDA to another, the Company shall provide deposit assistance for the rental of the second residence. When the Company renders deposit assistance for a second property without first receiving a refund of monies deposited on the first rental, the total deposit assistance outlay shall not exceed $20,000 between the two deposits; provided, however, that deposit assistance for a second property is available only if the pilot has made reasonable and timely efforts to obtain the return of his deposit by the landlord/lessor of the first property and has fully cooperated with the Company in this regard.</p>
        <p>iv. This deposit shall be paid directly to the landlord/lessor, as applicable, once the pilot supplies documentation establishing the existence of the deposit requirement.</p>
        <p>v. At the conclusion of the pilot&rsquo;s lease, the refundable portion of the deposit for which the assistance was provided shall be returned to the Company within 60 days after the pilot receives the funds.</p>
        <p>vi. The pilot/lessee shall manage his rental property in such a way as to minimize the amount, if any, withheld by the landlord/lessor. Absent extraordinary circumstances (e.g., failure to pay rent, photographically documented damage beyond normal wear and tear), the Company shall not seek reimbursement from the pilot with respect to deposit funds withheld by the pilot&rsquo;s landlord/lessor. Any reimbursements due from the pilot to the Company owing to reduced deposit assistance refunds shall be treated as adjustments or reimbursements as provided in <a target="_blank" href="#link_3E1avi">Section 3.E.1.a.vi.</a> of the basic Agreement. The Company shall not discipline or counsel the pilot with respect to deposit funds withheld by the pilot&rsquo;s landlord/lessor.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>m. Realtor&rsquo;s Fee</p>
      <p>If there is a customary, contractual realtor&rsquo;s fee associated with a pilot&rsquo;s rental of his permanent, primary residence, the Company shall cover the cost of up to two such fees during the pilot&rsquo;s initial commitment period in the FDA. For each additional 2 years of active service as a pilot in the FDA, the Company shall cover the cost of an additional realtor&rsquo;s fee; provided, however, that the Company&rsquo;s vendor for providing local real estate and orientation assistance reviews and approves the pilot&rsquo;s lease(s).</p>
      <p>n. Early Relocations Limitations</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i. A pilot may elect to relocate to the FDA up to 60 days before his activation date.</p>
        <p>ii. If the pilot elects to relocate prior to his activation date, upon his relocation, he shall be entitled to benefits associated with visas and other required credentials, seed money, storage, tax equalization, airline tickets, household goods shipment, orientation and housing search services, deposit assistance, and the realtor&rsquo;s fee assistance.</p>
        <p>iii. Requests to access the relocation benefits listed in Paragraph C.2.n.ii. of this LOA more than 60 days before a pilot&rsquo;s activation date shall be at the Company&rsquo;s discretion. If such a request is granted, it shall be on a non-precedential basis.</p>
        <p>iv.<a target="_blank" href="#link_6A8">Section 6.A.8.</a> of the basic Agreement shall apply to pilots who relocate prior to activation.</p>
        <p>v.   A pilot may be required to sign a confirmation letter acknowledging his early relocation benefits and responsibilities.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>o. Habitation Tax</p>
      <p>If a pilot&rsquo;s permanent, primary residence is within the acceptable radius of his base, as provided in Paragraph C.2.d.iii. of this LOA, and he incurs a Habitation Tax during his assignment to the EMEA FDA, such tax shall be covered by the Company on a tax free basis to the pilot.</p>
      <p>p. Relocation Upon Termination of Employment</p>
      <p>An FDA pilot whose employment with the Company is terminated due to retirement, voluntary resignation, or disciplinary discharge (for misconduct other than that described in <a target="_blank" href="#link_6E2biv">Section 6.E.2.b.iv.</a> of the basic Agreement) shall be eligible for the same return relocation benefits that he would be eligible for if he was relocating from the FDA as a result of an award to a new crew position.</p>
      <p>If an FDA pilot&rsquo;s employment with the Company is terminated due to misconduct described in <a target="_blank" href="#link_6E2biv">Section 6.E.2.b.iv.</a> of the basic Agreement, the terms and conditions of that provision shall apply, regardless of whether the pilot elected the Enhanced Option or the Existing CBA Option at the beginning of his assignment to the FDA.</p>
      <p>q. Miscellaneous Expense Reimbursements</p>
      <p>The Company shall reimburse an FDA pilot for the following miscellaneous expenses (receipts or other documentation required, regardless of amount), provided that such reimbursement requests are submitted within 90 days of the date the expense was incurred, in accordance with the Company&rsquo;s standard procedures concerning expense reporting:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i.   Wire transfer fees (up to a total of $600/calendar year but not more than 3 such wire transfers, or $50, per month) (Note: reimbursement requests shall be made on a quarterly basis only);</p>
        <p>ii.  Ground transportation expenses (up to a total of $600 each way per assignment to an FDA) for the pilot and the members of his immediate family who are relocating with him to the FDA, as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>(a)    from his pre-FDA domestic residence to the domestic <br>
            departure airport;</p>
          <p>(b)    from the FDA arrival airport to the initial stay hotel and/or the pilot&rsquo;s permanent, primary residence in the FDA;</p>
          <p>(c)    from the pilot&rsquo;s permanent, primary residence in the FDA to the exit transition hotel in the FDA and/or the FDA departure airport; and</p>
          <p>(d)    from the domestic arrival airport to the exit transition hotel and/or his post-FDA domestic residence.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In appropriate circumstances (e.g., size of pilot&rsquo;s traveling party, excess luggage, distance traveled, etc.) and on a case-by-case/non-precedential basis, the Company may reimburse ground transportation expenses in excess of $600. Requests for such reimbursements shall not be unreasonably denied.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>D. FDA Transition Procedures</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1.   Entry Transition to an FDA Crew Position from a Non-FDA Crew Position</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>a. A pilot who, at the beginning of his assignment to the FDA, elects to relocate his permanent, primary residence to the FDA rather than commute shall be subject to the following:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i.   Upon activation in an FDA crew position, the Company shall create a 21 consecutive day &ldquo;relocation footprint&rdquo; during which no flight activities will be assigned.</p>
        <p>ii.  During his relocation footprint, the pilot shall relocate his permanent, primary residence to the FDA and shall complete the required immigration, visa, work/residence permit paperwork necessary for the pilot to live and work in the FDA.</p>
        <p>iii. The pilot shall be positioned in the FDA, with all immigration, visa, and work/residence permit paperwork complete, and available for flight assignments no later than the 22nd day after the pilot&rsquo;s activation in the FDA crew position.</p>
        <p>iv.  The pilot may elect not to utilize the entire relocation footprint in the event that he has obtained all the necessary work/residence permits prior to the end of his relocation footprint.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>b. A pilot who elects to commute to the FDA rather than relocate his permanent, primary residence to the FDA shall request and coordinate with his Fleet Captain any schedule adjustments that involve dropping activities without pay to facilitate his transition to the FDA.</p>
      <p>c. Every new FDA pilot may be required to operate theatre familiarization flights, which shall be scheduled to occur as soon as operationally feasible after his arrival in the FDA (subject to the relocation footprint above).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>2.   Exit Transition from an FDA Crew Position to a Non-FDA Crew Position</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>a. Beginning no earlier than 120 days prior to an EMEA FDA pilot&rsquo;s anticipated departure date and upon written request by the pilot, the Company shall provide local assistance on the following: sending lease cancellation notice, accompanied property walk-through, documentation of property condition, negotiation of any &ldquo;dilapidations,&rdquo; recovery of security deposit, mail forwarding, bank account closings, utilities closings, local residency registration (notice of departure).</p>
      <p>Such assistance is not currently necessary in Hong Kong. In the event the parties agree that such assistance has become necessary in Hong Kong, the parties agree to revisit this issue.</p>
      <p>b. Hotel Use During Exit Transition</p>
      <p>Following the earlier of the date the pilot vacates his permanent, primary residence in the FDA or the end of his housing allowance, as provided in Paragraph C.2.d.vi., and prior to his activation in his next crew position, an exiting FDA pilot may elect to stay in a hotel for up to 15 nights in either:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i.   a location within 100 nm of the FDA base airport;</p>
        <p>ii.  the location of the pilot&rsquo;s pre- or post-FDA domestic residence; and/or</p>
        <p>iii. the pilot&rsquo;s new base, if he is relocating his permanent, primary residence to his new base.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The Company shall reimburse the pilot up to the contract hotel rate for such location, but in no event shall the Company reimburse the pilot more than $250/night. An exiting FDA pilot may receive the &ldquo;full&rdquo; or 30 day pro-rated housing allowance (as provided in Paragraph C.2.d.vi. of this LOA) and reimbursement of hotel expenses under this paragraph at the same time. An exiting FDA pilot may also receive the &ldquo;transition allowance&rdquo; as provided in Paragraph D.2.c. of this LOA and reimbursement of hotel expenses under this paragraph at the same time.</p>
      <p>c. Early Exit Option</p>
      <p> Prior to an FDA pilot&rsquo;s ITU training start date or his base transfer date, the pilot may elect to exercise an &ldquo;Early Exit&rdquo; option as follows:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i.   At a time jointly selected by the pilot and his Fleet Captain, the Company shall designate a 7 consecutive day &ldquo;transition footprint&rdquo; during which no flight activities will be assigned. To the extent that conflicts with the transition footprint exist, activities removed shall be pay protected. A pilot awarded a secondary line shall have 42 CH credited towards the pilot&rsquo;s BLG. The pilot&rsquo;s transition from the FDA must take place during the remaining bid periods prior to his ITU training start date or his base transfer date. The pilot shall use this transition footprint to relocate his permanent, primary residence from the FDA.</p>
        <p>ii.  The Company shall provide the pilot with 2 monthly &ldquo;transition allowance&rdquo; payments, which payments shall be equal to one-half (½) of the pilot&rsquo;s FDA&rsquo;s monthly housing allowance (i.e., a total of 1 month of the pilot&rsquo;s FDA&rsquo;s monthly housing allowance). A pilot may not receive the transition allowance and the housing allowance (full or pro-rated) in the same month, nor may the pilot receive the transition allowance after the month in which he activates in his new crew position.</p>
        <p>iii. If the pilot withdraws from ITU training for his new crew position and returns to his FDA crew position, he shall reimburse the transition allowance.</p>
        <p>iv.  The Company shall assume responsibility for lease termination fees (up to 2 months of rental/lease payments, but not more than 2 months of housing allowance payments) incurred by the pilot as a result of his transition from the FDA; provided, however, that the pilot has taken reasonable steps to minimize such early lease termination fees (e.g., bidding for an ITU training date/slot or base transfer date so as to minimize lease termination fees, etc.).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>d. An FDA pilot transitioning to a non-FDA crew position who does not elect the &ldquo;Early Exit Option&rdquo; shall be entitled to &ldquo;relocation days off&rdquo; following his activation date in his new crew position in accordance with the provisions of <a target="_blank" href="#link_6F">Section 6.F.</a> of the basic Agreement.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>3.   Transition Between FDA Crew Positions</p>
    <p>A pilot who is transitioning between FDA crew positions in different geographic locations shall be subject to all the provisions in Paragraph D.1. and D.2. of this LOA, except for Paragraph D.2.d. A pilot who is transitioning between FDA crew positions in the same FDA (e.g., an upgrade from 30FH to 30CH) shall not be subject to any of the provisions of Paragraph D. of this LOA. A pilot who is transitioning between crew positions in different FDAs but in the same geographic location shall be subject to the provisions of Paragraph O. of this LOA.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>E. Tax Equalization Services</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1.   An FDA pilot who relocates his permanent, primary residence to the FDA and receives the FDA housing allowance is required to use the tax equalization procedures and tax return filing services (US Federal, State, and foreign) offered by the Company through its tax equalization vendor.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>a. The purpose of tax equalization is to ensure that a pilot bears approximately the same US tax burden as he would pay if he were assigned to a domestic base rather than the FDA.</p>
      <p>b. To facilitate accurate tax computations and reporting, pilots will be required to provide all necessary tax information to the appointed tax provider. A pilot&rsquo;s persistent failure to maintain timely contact and completion of required documentation pertaining to the tax equalization program may result in suspension of the pilot&rsquo;s FDA housing allowance pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph C.2.d.v. of this LOA.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>2.   A pilot eligible for tax equalization services shall be entitled to any accrued tax benefits based on the enrollment of dependent children in private schools located in the country in which the FDA is centered (e.g., German tax deduction for children enrolled in private schools). Any taxes based on personal or religious choices (e.g., church tax, pet tax) are not covered by the tax equalization program and are the responsibility of the pilot.</p>
    <p>3.   If a pilot is not entitled to tax equalization services and his situation results in a foreign tax filing obligation in the country where the FDA airport is located, the Company shall provide foreign tax filing services through its tax equalization vendor.</p>
    <p>4.   In order to facilitate tax compliance in the country where the pilot&rsquo;s permanent, primary residence is located, and consistent with <a target="_blank" href="#link_26N2">Section 26.N.2.</a> of the basic Agreement, FDA pilots shall update their permanent, primary residence address in the applicable Company computer system as necessary.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>F. FDA Re-Mail Program</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1.   On a weekly basis, the Company shall forward a pilot&rsquo;s first class mail received at the Company&rsquo;s Memphis hub to the pilot&rsquo;s permanent, primary residence in the country containing the airport in which the FDA base is centered.</p>
    <p>2.   A HKG FDA pilot residing in the HKG Special Administrative Region (&ldquo;HKG SAR&rdquo;) may elect to receive such mail at the designated HKG FedEx facility (currently located at 63 Mody Road, Tsim Sha Tsui East, Hong Kong) instead of his permanent, primary residence in the HKG SAR. A HKG FDA pilot who does not reside in the HKG SAR will receive such mail at the Company&rsquo;s Guangzhou, China (CAN) hub.</p>
    <p>3.   For purposes of this provision, &ldquo;first class mail&rdquo; shall include, but not be limited to, personal correspondence mail and cards, credit card statements, bills, tax returns and notifications, mail order prescriptions, and documents issued by state and/or federal governments, that could otherwise be sent directly to the pilot at his permanent, primary residence address in the FDA pursuant to local governmental regulations.</p>
    <p>4. In the event the Company provided health plan allows mail order prescriptions to be delivered directly to the pilot&rsquo;s permanent, primary residence in the FDA, mail order prescriptions shall not be forwarded to the pilot pursuant to the re-mail program.</p>
    <p>5.   To the extent practicable, pilots assigned to FDAs must minimize the need for first class mail to be forwarded to them pursuant to the re-mail program by, for example, updating their address for first class mail to their permanent, primary residence address in the FDA.</p>
    <p>6.   In the event that a pilot will be absent from the FDA location for an extended period of time and elects to temporarily suspend the re-mail service during his absence, upon his return, the pilot must collect his mail from the designated FedEx facility and notify the Flight Operations Administrator for the FDA of his desire to restart the re-mail service.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>G. Education Expense Reimbursement</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1.   The Company shall reimburse documented educational expenses for an FDA-based pilot&rsquo;s child(ren) between the ages of 3 and 19, which are incurred in the location of the FDA (including but not limited to reservation fees, application fees, tuition, capital expenses, books and supplies, school provided transportation, deposits, technology fees, uniform fees and other expenses related to the child(ren)&rsquo;s education), up to $15,000 per family per school year.</p>
    <p>2.   Education Conflicts with ITU Training or Base Transfers</p>
    <p>The following applies to a pilot, who has completed his applicable commitment period, and who desires to minimize conflicts between ITU training or base transfers and their dependents&rsquo; enrollment in school in the FDA location.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p id="link_FDAG2a" class="link_highlight">a. During the ITU and base transfer bidding processes, an FDA pilot shall have the ability to designate his request to defer an ITU training date or base transfer date to which the pilot would have otherwise been assigned. The pilot shall have the ability to designate a preferred exit date. For FDA pilots based in an FDA centered in a European Union (&ldquo;EU&rdquo;) country, the preferred exit date shall comply with the time limit in Paragraph N.1. of this LOA.</p>
      <p>b. The granting of a deferral request shall not result in an SDP or Inverse SDP for any pilot. If granted, the pilot shall then be assigned to start training for his awarded/assigned crew position within 60 days of his preferred exit date. The pilot shall be given at least 60 days&rsquo; notice of his assigned ITU training start date or his base transfer activation date (as applicable).</p>
      <p>c. If the FDA pilot&rsquo;s request is denied and the pilot is assigned to a ITU training date or base transfer date that conflicts with the pilot&rsquo;s dependent&rsquo;s enrollment in school in the FDA location, the Company shall reimburse the pilot for any educational expenses that the pilot is responsible for beyond the pilot&rsquo;s activation date; provided however, that the pilot has taken reasonable steps to mitigate the need for the Company to reimburse the educational expenses.</p>
      <p>d. This paragraph shall not apply to an FDA pilot transitioning between crew positions in the same FDA or an FDA pilot subject to Paragraphs N., O., and P. of this LOA.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>H. Special Temporary Vacancies for FDAs</strong></p>
  <p>The following rules shall apply to Special Temporary Vacancies (STVs) in the FDA. STVs shall only be available for the first two years after each FDA opens. Thereafter, if the Company advises the Association in writing of its intent to close the FDA, the STV rules contained in this paragraph shall once again become available in the FDA that is closing, when the Company is regularly operating fewer than 50% of the aircraft which it regularly operated in that base at the time of the notification of its intent to close. The use of STVs in conjunction with a base closure is limited to 540 days from the Company&rsquo;s first use of the STV application rule in that context.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1.   STV awards shall have a duration between one and three bid periods.</p>
    <p>2.   STV awards shall begin and end concurrent with a bid period.</p>
    <p>3.   A STV posting shall specify the crew position(s) from which bids will be accepted and, if applicable, the number of bids which will be awarded at each domicile from which bids are accepted.</p>
    <p>4.   A pilot shall be entitled to one business class ticket positioning him to the STV location at the beginning of his assignment and back to his permanent base at the conclusion of his assignment. The Company shall also provide a pilot&rsquo;s dependents with one round-trip coach class ticket from the pilot&rsquo;s permanent, primary residence to the FDA location during the assignment.</p>
    <p>5.   The pilot shall be entitled to per diem for the duration of his STV assignment, when the pilot is not otherwise being paid per diem (e.g., on a trip). This shall be accomplished by the submission of a pay log unless pay automation eliminates the necessity for a pay log.</p>
    <p>6.   The pilot shall be entitled to Company paid lodging in accommodations of quality similar to that of the local contract hotels.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>I. Pilots Relocating from SFS to the EMEA or HKG FDAs</strong></p>
  <p>Provided he otherwise qualifies, a pilot formerly assigned to the SFS FDA may elect to take his FDA move back provided in <a target="_blank" href="#link_6E2b">Section 6.E.2.b.</a> of the basic Agreement, prior to his activation into the FDA. Once moved back to the United States, a pilot who selects the &ldquo;Enhanced Option&rdquo; may take advantage of the household goods storage provided in Paragraph C.2.c. of this LOA.</p>
  <p><strong>J. Pilots Relocating from ANC to the EMEA or HKG FDAs</strong></p>
  <p>For an ANC pilot who is entitled to a &ldquo;return move&rdquo; relocation package from ANC, the pilots may elect to be treated in the same fashion (except that their base is in ANC and not SFS) as the SFS pilots in Paragraph I. of this LOA.</p>
  <p><strong>K. Deadhead by Surface Transportation in the EMEA and HKG FDAs</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1.   Trains</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>a. Pilots may be scheduled to deadhead on trains in FDAs to the same extent as airplanes or ground transportation provided that, measured from scheduled departure time to scheduled arrival, trains may only be used on a scheduled basis for deadheads of less than 4<a id="_idTextAnchor622"></a> <a id="_idTextAnchor623"></a>hours,<a id="_idTextAnchor624"></a> with the following limitations:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i. Train travel shall only be scheduled between the following city pairs:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>(a) CGN-FRA;</p>
          <p>(b) CGN-CDG;</p>
          <p>(c) CDG-FRA; and</p>
          <p>(d)    CAN-HKG.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>ii.  Trains must have a minimum two class configuration, and the Company shall book the highest class of service that is readily accessible to the public (unless otherwise authorized by the SIG).</p>
        <p>iii. Train travel shall not be scheduled to occur between the hours of 0200-0459 LBT.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>b. Trains may be used in FDAs pursuant to <a target="_blank" href="#link_8A3c">Section 8.A.3.c.</a> of the basic Agreement to the same extent as other modes of transportation mentioned therein, not to exceed 7 hours measured from scheduled departure time to scheduled arrival. Such train travel shall be booked in the highest class of service that is readily accessible to the public. If the train lacks the minimum two class configuration or a higher class is not available, train travel may be used only less than 4 hours, measured from scheduled departure time to scheduled arrival, unless waived by the pilot.</p>

  <p><strong>N. Maximum Duration of Assignment to an FDA i<a id="_idTextAnchor660"></a>n a European Union Country and Subsequent Bidding Limitations</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1.   The maximum duration of assignment to an FDA centered in a European Union (&ldquo;EU&rdquo;) country shall be 4 years, 11 months as measured from the earlier of the pilot&rsquo;s activation date in his FDA crew position or his registration with local immigration authorities.</p>
    <p>2.   A pilot who has been stationed in an FDA centered in an EU country for 4 years shall have the ability to be awarded a crew position in another geographic location without a System Bid as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>a. The pilot shall notify his Fleet Captain (or his designee) in writing of the election under this paragraph at least 90 days prior to the pilot&rsquo;s 48th month in his FDA crew position, as measured from the earlier of the pilot&rsquo;s activation date in his FDA crew position or his registration with local immigration authorities. The pilot&rsquo;s notice shall include:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i.   The selection by the pilot of a crew position in a different geographic location in which he would not be the junior awarded/assigned pilot in that crew position.</p>
        <p>ii.  The pilot&rsquo;s preferred exit date (i.e., the date upon which the pilot desires to start ITU training for or base transfer to his selected crew position), which shall be no earlier than 4 years and no later than 4 years and 11 months following the earlier of the pilot&rsquo;s activation date in his FDA crew position or his registration with local immigration authorities. The Company shall assign the pilot to an ITU training start date or a base transfer activation date (subject to the applicable contractual provisions concerning the timing of base transfers, e.g., <a target="_blank" href="#link_25C6">Section 25.C.6.</a>), which shall not be less than 90 days from the date of the pilot&rsquo;s election.</p>
        <p>iii. The Company shall provide the pilot with a minimum of 60 days&rsquo; notice of his assigned ITU training start or base transfer activation date, which date shall be no earlier than the pilot&rsquo;s preferred exit date and no later than 21 days after the pilot&rsquo;s preferred exit date.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>b. If the pilot does not make this election, the Company shall assign the pilot to a crew position in a different geographic location in which he would not be the junior awarded/assigned pilot in that crew position. This shall occur at 4 years and 3 months following the earlier of the pilot&rsquo;s activation date in his FDA crew position or his registration with local immigration authorities. A pilot assigned to another crew position pursuant to this subparagraph may be assigned an ITU training start date or a base transfer activation date (subject to the applicable contractual provisions concerning the timing of base transfers, e.g., <a target="_blank" href="#link_25C6">Section 25.C.6.</a>) consistent with Company staffing requirements. The Company shall provide the pilot with a minimum of 60 days&rsquo; notice prior to the ITU training start date or base transfer activation date<a id="_idTextAnchor665"></a>.</p>
      <p id="link_FDAN2c" class="link_highlight">c. The exercise of this paragraph shall not be considered an assignment pursuant to <a target="_blank" href="#link_24C2">Section 24.C.2.</a> A pilot assigned to an ITU training date/slot pursuant to this paragraph shall not generate an SDP or an inverse SDP for any pilot.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>3.   After a pilot leaves an FDA centered in an EU country, he may not be activated in that crew base for at least one year after the last day of his previous assignment, provided that he activates in another crew position based outside of the country in which the FDA is centered and he establishes a permanent, primary residence outside of the country in which the FDA is centered. This limitation shall not apply if the subsequent crew base at which the pilot is stationed is centered in a country in which the pilot has never been based as a FedEx Express employee.</p>
    <p>4. If the Company establishes a new FDA in an EU country that requires a maximum duration different than the limit specified above, the Company shall publish that limit as provided in Paragraph B.1. of this LOA. All other provisions of this paragraph shall apply to such FDA.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>O. Crew Position Changes to Different FDAs in the Same Geographic Location</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If the Company opens multiple FDAs in the same geographic location (e.g., MD-11 HKG; A300 HKG), the following shall apply to pilots who activate into a different FDA within the same geographic location (e.g., an MD-11 F/O HKG upgrades to an A300 CA HKG).</p>
    <p>1. The following shall apply to pilots who chose the Enhanced Option as part of their original award:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>a. Such pilots shall be eligible for the benefits described in Paragraph C.2.a. (Seed Money) and C.2.b. (Four Year Service Credit) of this LOA, treating their new award as a completely separate award to an FDA in the EMEA or HKG.</p>
      <p>b. A pilot&rsquo;s activation into a different FDA in the same geographic location as his current FDA award restarts that pilot&rsquo;s service commitment under Paragraph C. of this LOA (i.e., the pilot&rsquo;s service in his prior FDA does not &ldquo;count&rdquo; toward his service commitment in the new FDA).</p>
      <p>c. The benefits described in Paragraph C.2.c. (Storage), C.2.d. (Housing Allowance), C.2.e. (Tax Equalization), C.2.f. (Airline Tickets), and C.2.h. (Household Goods Shipments) of this LOA shall be administered as if the pilot had not changed FDAs, but rather had been on one continuous assignment in the same FDA.</p>
      <p>d. If a pilot&rsquo;s crew position changes to a different FDA in the same geographic location and the pilot has not completed his original commitment period, the pilot shall not be eligible to receive the seed money otherwise provided by Paragraph O.1.a. of this LOA.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>2. Pilots who chose the Existing CBA Option as part of their original award shall continue to receive tax equalization benefits provided by Paragraph E. of this LOA.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p id="link_FDAP" class="link_highlight"><strong>P. FDA Exit in Lieu of Normal System Bid Award</strong></p>
  <p>A pilot activated in a crew position in an FDA without a maximum service limit as described in Paragraph N. of this LOA shall have the ability to select a new non-FDA crew position award without a System Bid award/assignment as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. The pilot shall notify his Fleet Captain (or his designee) in writing of the election under this paragraph, which shall include:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>a. The selection by the pilot of a non-FDA crew position in which he would not be the junior awarded/assigned pilot in that crew position; and</p>
      <p>b. The pilot&rsquo;s preferred exit date (i.e., the date upon which the pilot desires to start ITU training for or base transfer to his desired crew position), which shall not be less than 6 months from the date of the notice. The preferred exit date must be after the completion of the pilot&rsquo;s commitment period, plus 12 months.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>2. The Company shall notify the pilot if it requires a replacement pilot and shall conduct a System Bid within 30 days of the pilot&rsquo;s notice in accordance with Section 24 of the basic Agreement.</p>
    <p>3.   In the event the FDA vacancy is filled or a replacement pilot was not required, the Company shall provide the pilot with a minimum of 60 days&rsquo; notice of his assigned ITU training start or base transfer activation date, and such date must be within 75 days of the pilot&rsquo;s preferred exit date.</p>
    <p>4.   In the event that the posted vacancy is not filled, the Company may conduct another System Bid within 30 days of the closing of first System Bid.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>a. If the vacancy is filled or if the Company elects not to conduct a second System Bid, the Company shall provide the pilot with a minimum of 60 days&rsquo; notice of his assigned ITU training or base transfer date, and such date must be within 75 days of the pilot&rsquo;s preferred exit date.</p>
      <p>b. If the Company conducts a second System Bid and the vacancy is not filled for a second time, the Company shall provide the pilot with a minimum of 60 days&rsquo; notice of his assigned ITU training or base transfer date, and such date must be no later than 180 days beyond the preferred exit date.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>5. Pilots employing this paragraph shall be restricted from participating in System Bids until the pilot is transferred to his selected crew position or begins ITU training for his selected crew position, unless waived by the Vice President of Flight Operations.</p>
    <p>6. The exercise of this paragraph shall not be considered an assignment pursuant to <a target="_blank" href="#link_24C2">Section 24.C.2.</a> A pilot assigned to an ITU training date/slot pursuant to this paragraph shall not generate an SDP or an inverse SDP for any pilot.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q. Unexpected Unavailability In FDA</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. If an FDA pilot becomes unavailable for line flying (e.g., due to long-term sick leave, loss of medical, LTD, leave of absence, etc.) and the absence is expected to last longer than one year, the affected pilot may request that he and his dependents be returned from his FDA to his pre-FDA residence without penalty, pursuant to Paragraph C.2.f.i.(b). (Airline Tickets) and Paragraph C.2.h.ii. (Return Household Goods Shipment), Paragraph C.2.q.ii. (Reimbursement for Ground Transportation Expenses), and Paragraph D.2.a. and b. (Exit Transition Procedures). Such requests shall not be unreasonably denied.</p>
    <p>If the pilot does not make such a request, he shall be eligible to continue receiving the FDA housing allowance, provided that he maintains his permanent, primary residence in the FDA during the period of his unavailability.</p>
    <p>2.   If no request is made by the pilot after one year or more of absence, his circumstances shall be reviewed to determine if he is expected to be available to return to active flying within two years from the date of his first absence. In the event the decision is that the pilot will not be able to return to active flying during the 2 year period, the pilot will be given the option to either return to his pre-FDA residence without penalty or lose his FDA housing allowance for the period of his continued unavailability.</p>
    <p>3.   Regardless of which of these options the pilot elects, he may also request to be released from his FDA crew position and assigned (as that term is defined in Section 24) to another crew position in accordance with Paragraph B.4.d. of this LOA. Such requests shall not be unreasonably denied and shall be granted on a non-precedential basis.</p>
    <p>4.   In no event, however, shall the Company be obligated to provide more than a cumulative total of 26 months of housing allowance continuation pursuant to Paragraph Q. (this paragraph) during an assignment to an FDA.</p>
    <p>5.   If the pilot&rsquo;s unavailability for line flying is the result of a medical condition, the Company may direct the pilot to be evaluated by the Company&rsquo;s aeromedical advisor, in accordance with <a target="_blank" href="#link_15D">Section 15.D.</a>, but only to determine the expected duration of the pilot&rsquo;s unavailability. Referrals to the Company&rsquo;s aeromedical advisor pursuant to this paragraph shall not be considered a violation of <a target="_blank" href="#link_15D1">Section 15.D.1.</a> of the basic Agreement.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>R. Line of Credit Facilitation</strong></p>
  <p>The Company shall negotiate with a reputable local bank in the city in which the FDA is centered in an attempt to reduce or eliminate any minimum deposit requirements such bank may require to open a local bank account. The purpose of this provision is to attempt to provide at least one bank in each FDA where minimum deposits, beyond those customarily found in U.S. banks, are either not required, or at least minimized.</p>
  <p><strong>S. Timing of Recurrent Training Pay/Adjustments For FDA Assigned Pilots</strong></p>
  <p>If an FDA pilot&rsquo;s recurrent training award creates a phase-in conflict under the terms of the basic Agreement, the pay deduction for the trip(s) and/or R-day(s) dropped shall be delayed by one month from the standard schedule for phase-in conflict deductions.</p>
  <p id="link_FDAT" class="link_highlight"><strong>T.   Recurrent and ITU Training Deviation Travel</strong></p>
  <p>Notwithstanding the provisions of <a target="_blank" href="#link_8C2a">Sections 8.C.2.a.</a> and <a target="_blank" href="#link_8C4e">8.C.4.e.</a> of the basic Agreement to the contrary:</p>

      <p>d. For the purposes of this paragraph, a substitution window is a &ldquo;scheduled activity.&rdquo;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>3.   A pilot may create an expanded window through any, or all, of the following means:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>a. Monthly bid awards for the recurrent or ITU training month, as well as those months prior to and following recurrent or ITU training;</p>
      <p>b. Provisions of <a target="_blank" href="#link_25L">Section 25.L.</a> (e.g., dropping a trip(s) or R-day(s), or trading with open time or another pilot); and/or</p>
      <p>c. The use of scheduled vacation, including permissible vacation adjustments (e.g., exchange, trade, slide, expansion, or extension).</p>
    </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          <p>(a)    The contiguous 48 United States; or</p>
          <p>(b)    Another location if pre-approved, in writing (e-mail is sufficient), by the pilot&rsquo;s Fleet Captain (or his designee).</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>ii.  The second series of flights must begin at one of the locations described by Paragraph T.5.b.i.(a) or (b) of this LOA, and end at the location of the pilot&rsquo;s recurrent or ITU training. The second series of flights is not required to begin at the same location in which the first series of flights ended.</p>

      <p>c. Back-end Deviation(s)</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i.   The first series of flights must begin at the location of the pilot&rsquo;s recurrent or ITU training and end at a location described by Paragraph T.5.b.i.(a) or (b) of this LOA.</p>
        <p>ii.  The second series of flights must begin at a location described by Paragraph T.5.b.i.(a) or (b) of this LOA, and end at an airport in the FDA theatre of operations that is served by Company trunk aircraft or at a commercial passenger airport within 100 nm of the FDA base airport. The second series of flights is not required to begin at the same location in which the first series of flights ended.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>For purposes of this Paragraph T. of this LOA only, the phrase &ldquo;FDA theatre of operations&rdquo; refers to the sum of the lane segments typically operated as part of the EMEA network (for the EMEA FDA) or the APAC network (for the HKG FDA).

<p>The SLRWG shall be responsible for the development, implementation, and initial oversight and administration of the SLR as set forth in this LOA.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1. During the Development Period, the SLRWG shall (in no particular order):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>a.   Evaluate potential SLR automation vendors and make recommendations to the Company regarding the selection of the SLR automation vendor;</p>
    <p>b.   Determine the business requirements for the SLR automation, in conjunction with the SLR automation vendor, which shall include such requirements as pilot interface, secondary line construction logic, secondary line construction parameters, reasons reporting/preferences analysis requirements, hardware/software requirements, database specifications, etc.;</p>
    <p>c.   Establish system acceptance and testing criteria, including beta, end-user, and parallel testing and validation;</p>
    <p>d.   Develop the processes and procedures for identifying and resolving unforeseen or unanticipated secondary line construction anomalies and errors;</p>
    <p>e.   Design appropriate methods and means for training pilots in the use of the SLR (e.g., &ldquo;train the trainer,&rdquo; CBT modules, recurrent training curriculum, self-study, etc.), including recommendations concerning the timing and content of training provided to pilots by the Company;</p>
    <p>f.   Determine the processes and procedures for final acceptance of and transition to the SLR; and</p>
    <p>g.   Publish an initial SLR User Guide, which shall incorporate a complete description of the SLR operating system, including every schedule construction parameter, rule and procedure used in the operation of the SLR award logic.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>2. During the Implementation Period, the SLRWG shall (in no particular order):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>a.   Monitor secondary line construction;</p>
    <p>b.   Audit and verify the accuracy of secondary line construction results, including the resolution of unforeseen or unanticipated bidding anomalies and errors;</p>
    <p>c.   Oversee the secondary line construction error resolution process;</p>
    <p>d.   Review, modify, and update, as needed, training materials concerning the use of the SLR;</p>
    <p>e.   Review, modify, and update, as needed, the SLR User Guide; and</p>
    <p>f.   Recommend desirable system enhancements, including evaluation of new/replacement hardware, software, and/or vendor(s) to support such enhancements.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>3. In carrying out these responsibilities, the SLRWG shall strive to reach consensus on all decisions, determinations, and recommendations while also taking into account the parties&rsquo; mutual interest in appropriate fatigue risk management, enhancing pilots&rsquo; quality of life, efficient monthly schedule construction, operational integrity, and system reliability.</p>
  <p>4. If the SLRWG is unable to reach consensus, the SLRWG shall meet with the System Chief Pilot (or his designee), who shall use his best efforts to broker a consensus among the members of the SLRWG. In the event consensus cannot then be reached, the matter will be referred to the Vice President, Flight Operations, who shall make a recommendation to the SLRWG, taking into account the views and opinions of all the members of the SLRWG on the appropriate resolution of the issue. If the Association representatives on the SLRWG disagree with the recommendation, the Association may appeal the matter to the Senior Vice President, Flight Operations who will render a final decision after meeting with the Association&rsquo;s MEC Chairman or his designee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>C.   SLR Vendor Selection</strong></p>
<p>The Company shall select an SLR automation vendor, based on the recommendations from the SLRWG. Once an SLR automation vendor is selected, the Company shall not change the SLR automation vendor without the consent of the Association.</p>
<p><strong>D.   Development and Implementation Periods</strong></p>
<p>The Development Period shall commence upon implementation of the Company&rsquo;s upgrade to its current Secondary Line Generator automation and shall continue until no later than 3 months after the final acceptance of and transition to the SLR. The Implementation Period shall commence upon the final acceptance of and transition to the SLR and shall continue for 12 months thereafter.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the development and implementation timeline and procedures necessary to comply with the provisions of this LOA shall be established by agreement of the SLRWG.</p>
<p><strong>E.   Final Acceptance and Transition</strong></p>
<p>The MEC Chairman and the Vice President of Flight Operations must meet and agree on the final acceptance of the SLR prior to its implementation. In the absence of agreement, the SLR shall not be implemented.</p>
<p><strong>F.   On-Going Implementation Measures</strong></p>
<p>The parties recognize that the issues associated with the implementation and subsequent operation of the SLR are varied and fluid. Other measures facilitating the implementation and subsequent operation of the SLR may be implemented if agreed upon in writing by the Vice President, Labor Relations Law and the Association&rsquo;s MEC Chairman.</p>
<p><strong>G.   Effective Date and Duration</strong></p>
<p>This LOA is effective on the date signed and shall remain in full force and effect concurrent with the Basic Agreement.</p>

   <h1 class="persist-header">General Implementation Appendix and Timeline</h1>
   <p>2015 FedEx Pilot Collective Bargaining Agreement</p>
<p>This appendix sets out the timeline upon which each of the already-identified changes in the Tentative Agreement will be implemented following ratification. Items which are specifically referenced in the contract as having a later implementation date are not repeated in this appendix and will be implemented on the date specified in the Agreement. In the main table, all dates indicate that the particular provision will be implemented not later than the date stated. In the programming sub-appendices for work rules (Sections 4, 12, and 25), deadheading (Section 8), filling of crew positions (Section 24), and retirement and insurance (Sections 27 and 28), two dates are indicated – a target date, by which the Company intends to implement each particular change, and a delivery date, beyond which the Company would be in violation of the Agreement if it has not implemented the change. Under the Letter of Agreement entitled, &ldquo;Implementation and Transition,&rdquo; the parties may, by mutual agreement, alter the timelines set forth in this appendix to achieve a smooth transition into the new Agreement.</p>
